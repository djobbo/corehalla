/**
 * Utilities for working with immutable arrays (and non-empty arrays) in a
 * functional style. All functions treat arrays as immutable — they return new
 * arrays rather than mutating the input.
 *
 * ## Mental model
 *
 * - **`Array<A>`** is a standard JS array. All functions in this module return
 *   new arrays; the input is never mutated.
 * - **`NonEmptyReadonlyArray<A>`** (`readonly [A, ...Array<A>]`) is a readonly
 *   array guaranteed to have at least one element. Many functions preserve or
 *   require this guarantee at the type level.
 * - **`NonEmptyArray<A>`** is the mutable counterpart: `[A, ...Array<A>]`.
 * - Most functions are **dual** — they can be called either as
 *   `Array.fn(array, arg)` (data-first) or piped as
 *   `pipe(array, Array.fn(arg))` (data-last).
 * - Functions that access elements by index return `Option<A>` for safety; use
 *   the `*NonEmpty` variants (e.g. {@link headNonEmpty}) when you already know
 *   the array is non-empty.
 * - Set-like operations ({@link union}, {@link intersection},
 *   {@link difference}) use `Equal.equivalence()` by default; use the `*With`
 *   variants for custom equality.
 *
 * ## Common tasks
 *
 * - **Create** an array: {@link make}, {@link of}, {@link empty},
 *   {@link fromIterable}, {@link range}, {@link makeBy}, {@link replicate},
 *   {@link unfold}
 * - **Access** elements: {@link head}, {@link last}, {@link get}, {@link tail},
 *   {@link init}
 * - **Transform**: {@link map}, {@link flatMap}, {@link flatten}
 * - **Filter**: {@link filter}, {@link partition}, {@link dedupe}
 * - **Combine**: {@link append}, {@link prepend}, {@link appendAll},
 *   {@link prependAll}, {@link zip}, {@link cartesian}
 * - **Split**: {@link splitAt}, {@link chunksOf}, {@link span}, {@link window}
 * - **Search**: {@link findFirst}, {@link findLast}, {@link contains}
 * - **Sort**: {@link sort}, {@link sortBy}, {@link sortWith}
 * - **Fold**: {@link reduce}, {@link scan}, {@link join}
 * - **Group**: {@link groupBy}, {@link group}, {@link groupWith}
 * - **Set operations**: {@link union}, {@link intersection},
 *   {@link difference}
 * - **Match** on empty vs non-empty: {@link match}, {@link matchLeft},
 *   {@link matchRight}
 * - **Check** properties: {@link isArray}, {@link isArrayNonEmpty},
 *   {@link every}, {@link some}
 *
 * ## Gotchas
 *
 * - {@link fromIterable} returns the original array reference when given an
 *   array; if you need a copy, use {@link copy}.
 * - `sort`, `reverse`, etc. always allocate a new array — the input is never
 *   mutated.
 * - {@link makeBy} and {@link replicate} normalize `n` to an integer >= 1 —
 *   they never produce an empty array.
 * - {@link range}`(start, end)` is inclusive on both ends. If `start > end` it
 *   returns `[start]`.
 * - Functions returning `Option` (e.g. {@link head}, {@link findFirst}) return
 *   `Option.none()` for empty inputs — they never throw.
 *
 * ## Quickstart
 *
 * **Example** (Basic array operations)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Array } from "effect"
 *
 * const numbers = Array.make(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
 *
 * const doubled = Array.map(numbers, (n) => n * 2)
 * console.log(doubled) // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
 *
 * const evens = Array.filter(numbers, (n) => n % 2 === 0)
 * console.log(evens) // [2, 4]
 *
 * const sum = Array.reduce(numbers, 0, (acc, n) => acc + n)
 * console.log(sum) // 15
 * ```

 *
 * Internally, `BigDecimal` uses a `BigInt` object, paired with a 64-bit integer which determines the position of the

/**
 * The `Cache` module provides an effectful, mutable key-value cache for values
 * that are computed by a lookup function. A `Cache<Key, A, E, R>` stores lookup
 * results for keys, shares concurrent lookups for the same key, and manages
 * entry lifetime with capacity limits and optional time-to-live policies.
 *
 * **Mental model**
 *
 * - A cache is created from a lookup function and a maximum capacity
 * - {@link get} returns a cached value when present, or runs the lookup on a miss
 * - Concurrent misses for the same key share one pending lookup
 * - Lookup failures are cached as failures until the entry expires, is invalidated, or is refreshed
 * - Entries can live forever, expire after a fixed duration, or use a dynamic TTL based on the lookup `Exit`
 * - Capacity is enforced by removing the oldest stored entries when new entries are added
 *
 * **Common tasks**
 *
 * - Create a cache: {@link make}, {@link makeWith}
 * - Read values: {@link get}, {@link getOption}, {@link getSuccess}
 * - Seed or overwrite values: {@link set}
 * - Refresh values: {@link refresh}
 * - Remove entries: {@link invalidate}, {@link invalidateWhen}, {@link invalidateAll}
 * - Inspect contents: {@link has}, {@link size}, {@link keys}, {@link values}, {@link entries}
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * - {@link getOption} does not run the lookup; it only reads an existing non-expired entry
 * - {@link size} may include expired entries until they are observed and removed
 * - {@link values} and {@link entries} include only successfully resolved entries
 * - Use `Data` or another `Equal`-compatible key type when keys need structural equality

/**
 * Structured representation of how an Effect can fail.
 *
 * A `Cause<E>` holds a flat array of `Reason` values, where each reason is one of:
 *
 * - **Fail** — a typed, expected error `E` (created by `Effect.fail`)
 * - **Die** — an untyped defect (`unknown`) from `Effect.die` or uncaught throws
 * - **Interrupt** — a fiber interruption, optionally carrying the interrupting fiber's ID
 *
 * ## Mental model
 *
 * - A `Cause` is always flat: concurrent and sequential failures are stored together
 *   in `cause.reasons` (a `ReadonlyArray<Reason<E>>`).
 * - Each `Reason` carries an `annotations` map with tracing metadata (stack frames, spans).
 * - An empty `reasons` array means the computation succeeded or the cause was empty
 *   ({@link empty}).
 * - `Cause` implements `Equal`, so two causes with identical reasons compare as equal.
 *
 * ## Common tasks
 *
 * | Intent | API |
 * |--------|-----|
 * | Create a cause | {@link fail}, {@link die}, {@link interrupt}, {@link fromReasons} |
 * | Test for reason types | {@link hasFails}, {@link hasDies}, {@link hasInterrupts} |
 * | Extract the first error/defect | {@link findError}, {@link findDefect}, {@link findFail}, {@link findDie} |
 * | Iterate over reasons manually | `cause.reasons.filter(Cause.isFailReason)` |
 * | Combine two causes | {@link combine} |
 * | Transform errors | {@link map} |
 * | Collapse to a single thrown value | {@link squash} |
 * | Render for logging | {@link pretty}, {@link prettyErrors} |
 * | Attach/read tracing metadata | {@link annotate}, {@link annotations}, {@link reasonAnnotations} |
 *
 * ## Gotchas
 *
 * - `findError`/`findDefect` return `Filter.fail` (not `Option.none`) when no match is
 *   found. Use {@link findErrorOption} if you need an `Option`.
 * - `squash` picks the first `Fail` error, then the first `Die` defect, then falls back
 *   to a generic "interrupted" / "empty" error. It is lossy — use `prettyErrors` or
 *   iterate `reasons` directly when you need all failures.
 * - The module also exports several built-in error classes (`NoSuchElementError`,
 *   `TimeoutError`, `IllegalArgumentError`, `ExceededCapacityError`, `UnknownError`)
 *   and the `Done` completion signal. These all implement `YieldableError` and can be
 *   yielded directly inside `Effect.gen`.
 *
 * **Example** (inspecting a concurrent failure)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Cause, Effect } from "effect"
 *
 * const program = Effect.gen(function*() {
 *   const cause = yield* Effect.sandbox(
 *     Effect.all([

/**
 * The `Channel` module provides a powerful abstraction for bi-directional communication
 * and streaming operations. A `Channel` is a nexus of I/O operations that supports both
 * reading and writing, forming the foundation for Effect's Stream and Sink abstractions.
 *
 * ## What is a Channel?
 *
 * A `Channel<OutElem, OutErr, OutDone, InElem, InErr, InDone, Env>` represents:
 * - **OutElem**: The type of elements the channel outputs
 * - **OutErr**: The type of errors the channel can produce
 * - **OutDone**: The type of the final value when the channel completes
 * - **InElem**: The type of elements the channel reads
 * - **InErr**: The type of errors the channel can receive
 * - **InDone**: The type of the final value from upstream
 * - **Env**: The environment/context required by the channel
 *
 * ## Key Features
 *
 * - **Bi-directional**: Channels can both read and write
 * - **Composable**: Channels can be piped, sequenced, and concatenated
 * - **Resource-safe**: Automatic cleanup and resource management
 * - **Error-handling**: Built-in error propagation and handling
 * - **Concurrent**: Support for concurrent operations
 *
 * ## Composition Patterns
 *
 * 1. **Piping**: Connect channels where output of one becomes input of another
 * 2. **Sequencing**: Use the result of one channel to create another
 * 3. **Concatenating**: Combine multiple channels into a single channel
 *
 * **Example** (Creating a simple channel)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Channel } from "effect"
 *
 * // Simple channel that outputs numbers
 * const numberChannel = Channel.succeed(42)
 *
 * // Transform channel that doubles values
 * const doubleChannel = Channel.map(numberChannel, (n) => n * 2)
 *
 * // Running the channel would output: 84
 * ```
 *
 * **Example** (Transforming array-backed channels)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Channel } from "effect"
 *
 * // Channel from an array of values
 * const arrayChannel = Channel.fromArray([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
 *
 * // Transform the channel by mapping over values
 * const transformedChannel = Channel.map(arrayChannel, (n) => n * 2)
 *
 * // This channel will output: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10

/**
 * The `ChannelSchema` module provides helpers for applying `Schema` encoding
 * and decoding at `Channel` boundaries. It is useful when a channel should
 * expose typed values to application code while communicating with an upstream
 * or downstream component through an encoded representation such as JSON-ready
 * data, wire protocol values, or any other schema-defined format.
 *
 * **Mental model**
 *
 * - A channel schema adapter is a streaming boundary: chunks flow through a
 *   `Channel`, and each non-empty chunk is validated and transformed with a
 *   `Schema`
 * - `encode` turns typed schema values into their encoded representation before
 *   they leave a typed part of a pipeline
 * - `decode` turns encoded input into typed schema values before application
 *   code consumes them
 * - `duplex` wraps a bidirectional channel so callers work with typed input and
 *   output while the wrapped channel continues to operate on encoded chunks
 * - Schema failures are surfaced through the channel error type as
 *   `SchemaError`, and schema services are reflected in the channel
 *   requirements
 *
 * **Common tasks**
 *
 * - Encode typed channel input before sending it to an encoded transport:
 *   {@link encode}
 * - Decode encoded channel output before handling it as domain data:
 *   {@link decode}
 * - Use unknown encoded boundaries when static encoded types are intentionally
 *   erased: {@link encodeUnknown} and {@link decodeUnknown}
 * - Wrap a bidirectional encoded channel with typed input and output schemas:
 *   {@link duplex} or {@link duplexUnknown}
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * - These helpers operate on `NonEmptyReadonlyArray` chunks, so schemas are
 *   applied to non-empty batches rather than individual scalar values
 * - Encoding and decoding can require services from the schema; those
 *   requirements become part of the resulting channel type
 * - `duplex` encodes values flowing into the wrapped channel and decodes values
 *   emitted by it, so choose `inputSchema` and `outputSchema` from the
 *   perspective of the typed caller

/**
 * The `Chunk` module provides an immutable, high-performance sequence data structure
 * optimized for functional programming patterns. A `Chunk` is a persistent data structure
 * that supports efficient append, prepend, and concatenation operations.
 *
 * ## What is a Chunk?
 *
 * A `Chunk<A>` is an immutable sequence of elements of type `A` that provides:
 * - **O(1) append and prepend operations**
 * - **Efficient concatenation** through tree-like structure
 * - **Memory efficiency** with structural sharing
 * - **Rich API** with functional programming operations
 * - **Type safety** with full TypeScript integration
 *
 * ## Key Features
 *
 * - **Immutable**: All operations return new chunks without modifying the original
 * - **Efficient**: Optimized data structure with logarithmic complexity for most operations
 * - **Functional**: Rich set of transformation and combination operators
 * - **Lazy evaluation**: Many operations are deferred until needed
 * - **Interoperable**: Easy conversion to/from arrays and other collections
 *
 * ## Performance Characteristics
 *
 * - **Append/Prepend**: O(1) amortized
 * - **Random Access**: O(log n)
 * - **Concatenation**: O(log min(m, n))
 * - **Iteration**: O(n)
 * - **Memory**: Structural sharing minimizes allocation
 *
 * **Example** (Creating and combining chunks)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Chunk } from "effect"
 *
 * // Creating chunks
 * const chunk1 = Chunk.fromIterable([1, 2, 3])
 * const chunk2 = Chunk.fromIterable([4, 5, 6])
 * const empty = Chunk.empty<number>()
 *
 * // Combining chunks
 * const combined = Chunk.appendAll(chunk1, chunk2)
 * console.log(Chunk.toReadonlyArray(combined)) // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
 * ```
 *
 * **Example** (Transforming chunks)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Chunk } from "effect"
 *
 * // Functional transformations
 * const numbers = Chunk.range(1, 5) // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
 * const doubled = Chunk.map(numbers, (n) => n * 2) // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
 * const evens = Chunk.filter(doubled, (n) => n % 4 === 0) // [4, 8]
 * const sum = Chunk.reduce(evens, 0, (acc, n) => acc + n) // 12
 * ```
 *
 * **Example** (Processing chunks with Effect)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Chunk, Effect } from "effect"
 *
 * // Working with Effects
 * const processChunk = Effect.fnUntraced(function*(chunk: Chunk.Chunk<number>) {

/**
 * The `Clock` module provides functionality for time-based operations in Effect applications.
 * It offers precise time measurements, scheduling capabilities, and controlled time management
 * for testing scenarios.
 *
 * The Clock service is a core component of the Effect runtime, providing:
 * - Current time access in milliseconds and nanoseconds
 * - Sleep operations for delaying execution
 * - Time-based scheduling primitives
 * - Testable time control through `TestClock`
 *
 * ## Key Features
 *
 * - **Precise timing**: Access to both millisecond and nanosecond precision
 * - **Sleep operations**: Non-blocking sleep with proper interruption handling
 * - **Service integration**: Seamless integration with Effect's dependency injection
 * - **Testable**: Mock time control for deterministic testing
 * - **Resource-safe**: Automatic cleanup of time-based resources
 *
 * **Example** (Measuring elapsed time)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Clock, Effect } from "effect"
 *
 * // Get current time in milliseconds
 * const getCurrentTime = Clock.currentTimeMillis
 *
 * // Sleep for 1 second
 * const sleep1Second = Effect.sleep("1 seconds")

/**
 * A module for combining two values of the same type into one.
 *
 * A `Combiner<A>` wraps a single binary function `(self: A, that: A) => A`.
 * It describes *how* two values merge but carries no initial/empty value
 * (for that, see {@link Reducer} which extends `Combiner` with an
 * `initialValue`).
 *
 * ## Mental model
 *
 * - **Combiner** – an object with a `combine(self, that)` method that returns
 *   a value of the same type.
 * - **Argument order** – `self` is the "left" / accumulator side, `that` is
 *   the "right" / incoming side.
 * - **No identity element** – unlike a monoid, a `Combiner` does not require
 *   a neutral element. Use {@link Reducer} when you need one.
 * - **Purity** – all combiners produced by this module are pure; they never
 *   mutate their arguments.
 * - **Composability** – combiners can be lifted into `Option`, `Struct`,
 *   `Tuple`, and other container types via helpers in those modules.
 *
 * ## Common tasks
 *
 * - Create a combiner from any binary function → {@link make}
 * - Swap argument order → {@link flip}
 * - Pick the smaller / larger of two values → {@link min} / {@link max}
 * - Always keep the first or last value → {@link first} / {@link last}
 * - Ignore both values and return a fixed result → {@link constant}
 * - Insert a separator between combined values → {@link intercalate}
 *
 * ## Gotchas
 *
 * - `min` and `max` require an `Order<A>`, not a raw comparator. Import from
 *   e.g. `Number.Order` or `String.Order`.
 * - `intercalate` is curried: call it with the separator first, then pass the
 *   base combiner.
 * - A `Reducer` (which adds `initialValue`) is also a valid `Combiner` — you
 *   can pass a `Reducer` anywhere a `Combiner` is expected.
 *
 * ## Quickstart
 *
 * **Example** (combining strings with a separator)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Combiner, String } from "effect"
 *
 * const csv = Combiner.intercalate(",")(String.ReducerConcat)
 *
 * console.log(csv.combine("a", "b"))
 * // Output: "a,b"
 *
 * console.log(csv.combine(csv.combine("a", "b"), "c"))
 * // Output: "a,b,c"

/**
 * Declarative, schema-driven configuration loading. A `Config<T>` describes
 * how to read and validate a value of type `T` from a `ConfigProvider`. Configs
 * can be composed, transformed, and used directly as Effects.
 *
 * ## Mental model
 *
 * - **Config\<T\>** – a recipe for extracting a typed value from a
 *   `ConfigProvider`. Created via convenience constructors or {@link schema}.
 * - **ConfigProvider** – the backing data source (env vars, JSON, `.env`
 *   files). See the `ConfigProvider` module.
 * - **ConfigError** – wraps either a `SourceError` (provider I/O failure) or
 *   a `SchemaError` (validation / decoding failure).
 * - **parse** – instance method on every `Config` that takes a provider and
 *   returns `Effect<T, ConfigError>`.
 * - **Yieldable** – every `Config` can be yielded inside `Effect.gen`. It
 *   automatically resolves the current `ConfigProvider` from the context.
 *
 * ## Common tasks
 *
 * - Read a single env var → {@link string}, {@link number}, {@link boolean},
 *   {@link int}, {@link port}, {@link url}, {@link date}, {@link duration},
 *   {@link logLevel}, {@link redacted}
 * - Read a structured config → {@link schema} with a `Schema.Struct`
 * - Provide a default → {@link withDefault}
 * - Make a config optional → {@link option}
 * - Transform a value → {@link map} / {@link mapOrFail}
 * - Fall back on error → {@link orElse}
 * - Combine multiple configs → {@link all}
 * - Build from a `Schema.Codec` → {@link schema}
 * - Always succeed or fail → {@link succeed} / {@link fail}
 *
 * ## Gotchas
 *
 * - `withDefault` and `option` only apply when the error is caused by
 *   **missing data**. Validation errors (wrong type, out of range) still
 *   propagate.
 * - When yielded in `Effect.gen`, the config resolves using the current
 *   `ConfigProvider` service. To use a specific provider, call `.parse(provider)`
 *   instead.
 * - The `name` parameter on convenience constructors (e.g. `Config.string("HOST")`)
 *   sets the root path segment. Omit it when the config is part of a larger
 *   schema.
 *
 * ## Quickstart
 *
 * **Example** (Reading typed config from environment variables)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Config, ConfigProvider, Effect, Schema } from "effect"

 *
 * ## Mental model
 *
 * - **Node** – a discriminated union (`Value | Record | Array`) that describes
 *   what lives at a given path in the configuration tree.
 * - **Path** – an array of string or numeric segments used to address a node
 *   (e.g. `["database", "host"]`).
 * - **ConfigProvider** – an object with a `load(path)` method that resolves a
 *   path to a `Node | undefined`. Providers can be composed and transformed.
 * - **Context.Reference** – `ConfigProvider` is registered as a reference
 *   service that defaults to `fromEnv()`, so it works without explicit
 *   provision.
 * - **SourceError** – the typed error returned when a backing store is
 *   unreadable (I/O failure, permission error, etc.).

 * ## Gotchas
 *
 * - `fromEnv` joins path segments with `_` for lookup **and** splits env var
 *   names on `_` to discover child keys. `DATABASE_HOST=x` is therefore
 *   accessible at both `["DATABASE_HOST"]` and `["DATABASE", "HOST"]`.
 * - Because of `_` splitting, querying a parent path like `["DATABASE"]`
 *   returns a `Record` node with child key `"HOST"`, even if no env var
 *   named `DATABASE` exists.
 * - When using `fromEnv` with schemas that use camelCase keys, pipe the
 *   provider through {@link constantCase} so `databaseHost` resolves to
 *   `DATABASE_HOST`.
 * - `orElse` only falls back when the primary provider returns `undefined`
 *   (path not found). It does **not** catch `SourceError`.
 * - `nested` prepends segments to the path *after* `mapInput` has run, so
 *   the order of composition matters.
 *
 * ## Quickstart
 *
 * **Example** (Reading config from environment variables)

 * ```ts
 * import { Config, ConfigProvider, Effect } from "effect"

/**
 * The `Console` module provides a functional interface for console operations within
 * the Effect ecosystem. It offers type-safe logging, debugging, and console manipulation
 * capabilities with built-in support for testing and environment isolation.
 *
 * ## Key Features
 *
 * - **Type-safe logging**: All console operations return Effects for composability
 * - **Testable**: Mock console output for testing scenarios
 * - **Service-based**: Integrated with Effect's dependency injection system
 * - **Environment isolation**: Different console implementations per environment
 * - **Rich API**: Support for all standard console methods (log, error, debug, etc.)
 * - **Performance tracking**: Built-in timing and profiling capabilities
 *
 * ## Core Operations
 *
 * - **Basic logging**: `log`, `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`
 * - **Assertions**: `assert` for conditional logging
 * - **Grouping**: `group`, `groupCollapsed`, `groupEnd` for organized output
 * - **Timing**: `time`, `timeEnd`, `timeLog` for performance measurement
 * - **Data display**: `table`, `dir`, `dirxml` for structured data visualization
 * - **Utilities**: `clear`, `count`, `countReset`, `trace`
 *
 * **Example** (Logging basic messages)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Console, Effect } from "effect"
 *
 * // Basic logging
 * const program = Effect.gen(function*() {
 *   yield* Console.log("Hello, World!")
 *   yield* Console.error("Something went wrong")
 *   yield* Console.warn("This is a warning")
 *   yield* Console.info("Information message")
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * **Example** (Grouping timed logs)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Console, Effect } from "effect"
 *
 * // Grouped logging with timing
 * const debugProgram = Console.withGroup(
 *   Effect.gen(function*() {
 *     yield* Console.log("Step 1: Loading...")
 *     yield* Effect.sleep("100 millis")

/**
 * The `Cron` module provides utilities for representing recurring calendar
 * schedules with cron expressions. A `Cron` value stores allowed seconds,
 * minutes, hours, days of month, months, weekdays, and an optional time zone,
 * then uses those constraints to test dates and find scheduled occurrences.
 *
 * **Mental model**
 *
 * - A cron schedule is a set of allowed values for each time field
 * - Expressions may use five fields (`minute hour day month weekday`) or six
 *   fields (`second minute hour day month weekday`); five-field expressions
 *   default seconds to `0`
 * - Each field supports `*`, comma-separated values, ranges, and step syntax
 * - Month and weekday fields support aliases such as `JAN`, `DEC`, `SUN`, and
 *   `MON`
 * - Empty internal field sets represent an unconstrained field, the same idea
 *   as `*`
 * - When both day-of-month and weekday are constrained, matching uses cron's
 *   inclusive behavior: either field may match
 *
 * **Common tasks**
 *
 * - Build directly from field constraints: {@link make}
 * - Parse expressions safely: {@link parse}
 * - Parse expressions and throw on invalid input: {@link parseUnsafe}
 * - Check whether a date satisfies a schedule: {@link match}
 * - Find adjacent scheduled dates: {@link next}, {@link prev}
 * - Iterate future scheduled dates: {@link sequence}
 * - Compare schedule constraints: {@link equals}, {@link Equivalence}
 * - Detect parse failures: {@link CronParseError}, {@link isCronParseError}
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * - Weekdays are numbered `0` through `6`, with `0` representing Sunday
 * - Months are numbered `1` through `12`, while JavaScript `Date` months are
 *   zero-based
 * - `*` normalizes to an empty set internally, so inspect schedules with the
 *   public helpers instead of assuming every allowed value is stored
 * - `next` and `prev` search strictly after or before the provided instant
 * - Time-zone-aware schedules account for daylight saving transitions; during
 *   a fall-back transition, repeated local times are emitted once when moving

/**
 * Immutable data constructors with discriminated-union support.
 *
 * The `Data` module provides base classes and factory functions for creating
 * immutable value types with a `_tag` field for discriminated unions.
 * It is the recommended way to define domain models, error types, and
 * lightweight ADTs in Effect applications.
 *
 * ## Mental model
 *
 * - **`Class`** — base class for plain immutable data. Extend it with a type
 *   parameter to declare the fields. Instances are `Pipeable`.
 * - **`TaggedClass`** — like `Class` but automatically adds a `readonly _tag`
 *   string literal field. Useful for single-variant types or ad-hoc tagged
 *   values.
 * - **`TaggedEnum`** (type) + **`taggedEnum`** (value) — define a multi-variant
 *   discriminated union from a simple record. `taggedEnum()` returns per-variant
 *   constructors plus `$is` / `$match` helpers.
 * - **`Error`** — like `Class` but extends `Cause.YieldableError`, so instances
 *   can be yielded inside `Effect.gen` to fail the effect.
 * - **`TaggedError`** — like `TaggedClass` but extends `Cause.YieldableError`.
 *   Works with `Effect.catchTag` for tag-based error recovery.
 *
 * ## Common tasks
 *
 * - Define a simple value class → {@link Class}
 * - Define a value class with a `_tag` → {@link TaggedClass}
 * - Define a discriminated union with constructors → {@link TaggedEnum} + {@link taggedEnum}
 * - Define a yieldable error → {@link Error}
 * - Define a yieldable tagged error → {@link TaggedError}
 * - Type-guard a tagged value → `$is` from {@link taggedEnum}
 * - Pattern-match on a tagged union → `$match` from {@link taggedEnum}
 *
 * ## Gotchas
 *
 * - Variant records passed to `TaggedEnum` must **not** contain a `_tag` key;
 *   the `_tag` is added automatically from the record key.
 * - When a class has no fields, the constructor argument is optional (`void`).
 * - `taggedEnum()` creates **plain objects**, not class instances. If you need
 *   class-based variants, use `TaggedClass` or `TaggedError` instead.
 * - `TaggedEnum.WithGenerics` supports up to 4 generic type parameters.
 *
 * ## Quickstart
 *
 * **Example** (tagged union with pattern matching)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Data } from "effect"
 *
 * type Shape = Data.TaggedEnum<{
 *   Circle: { readonly radius: number }

/**
 * The `DateTime` module provides immutable data types and utilities for working
 * with instants, UTC date-times, zoned date-times, and time zones. A
 * `DateTime` is always an absolute point in time, represented internally by
 * epoch milliseconds, and may also carry a `TimeZone` for zone-aware calendar
 * parts and formatting.
 *
 * **Mental model**
 *
 * - `DateTime` is a discriminated union: `Utc | Zoned`
 * - `Utc` stores an absolute instant without an associated time zone
 * - `Zoned` stores the same kind of absolute instant plus a `TimeZone`
 * - Time zones can be fixed offsets or named IANA zones such as `"Europe/Rome"`
 * - Comparison and ordering use the instant, so two values in different zones
 *   can still be equivalent
 * - Calendar parts and formatted output depend on whether you ask for UTC parts
 *   or zone-adjusted parts
 *
 * **Common tasks**
 *
 * - Construct values: {@link make}, {@link makeUnsafe}, {@link makeZoned}, {@link makeZonedUnsafe}
 * - Get the current instant: {@link now}, {@link nowInCurrentZone}
 * - Create time zones: {@link zoneMakeOffset}, {@link zoneMakeNamed}, {@link zoneFromString}
 * - Attach or change zones: {@link setZone}, {@link setZoneNamed}, {@link setZoneCurrent}, {@link toUtc}
 * - Convert to platform values or parts: {@link toDate}, {@link toDateUtc}, {@link toEpochMillis}, {@link toParts}, {@link toPartsUtc}
 * - Compare and bound values: {@link Equivalence}, {@link Order}, {@link distance}, {@link min}, {@link max}, {@link clamp}, {@link between}
 * - Transform values: {@link add}, {@link subtract}, {@link startOf}, {@link endOf}, {@link nearest}, {@link setParts}, {@link mutate}
 * - Format values: {@link format}, {@link formatUtc}, {@link formatLocal}, {@link formatIntl}, {@link formatIso}, {@link formatIsoZoned}
 * - Provide an application time zone: {@link CurrentTimeZone}, {@link withCurrentZone}, {@link layerCurrentZone}
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * - `make` and `makeZoned` return `Option`; unsafe constructors throw on invalid
 *   input
 * - `DateTime` equality is instant-based, not display-time-based
 * - `setZone` changes the zone used for local parts and formatting without
 *   changing the represented instant
 * - Use `adjustForTimeZone` with {@link makeZoned} when input parts should be
 *   interpreted as wall-clock time in the target zone
 * - Daylight-saving gaps and repeated local times are resolved with
 *   `Disambiguation`
 * - Prefer the Clock-backed {@link now} and `CurrentTimeZone` services in
 *   Effect workflows; unsafe helpers read from the host environment directly

/**
 * This module provides utilities for working with `Deferred`, a powerful concurrency
 * primitive that represents an asynchronous variable that can be set exactly once.
 * Multiple fibers can await the same `Deferred` and will all be notified when it
 * completes.
 *
 * A `Deferred<A, E>` can be:
 * - **Completed successfully** with a value of type `A`
 * - **Failed** with an error of type `E`
 * - **Interrupted** if the fiber setting it is interrupted
 *
 * Key characteristics:
 * - **Single assignment**: Can only be completed once
 * - **Multiple waiters**: Many fibers can await the same `Deferred`
 * - **Fiber-safe**: Thread-safe operations across concurrent fibers
 * - **Composable**: Works seamlessly with other Effect operations
 *
 * **Example** (Coordinating fibers with a Deferred)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Deferred, Effect, Fiber } from "effect"
 *
 * // Basic usage: coordinate between fibers

/**
 * The `Differ` module defines the core abstraction for describing changes to a
 * value. A `Differ<T, Patch>` knows how to compare two `T` values, produce a
 * patch that represents the difference, combine multiple patches, and apply a
 * patch to an old value to obtain the updated value.
 *
 * **Mental model**
 *
 * - A differ separates "what changed" from "the value after the change"
 * - `diff(oldValue, newValue)` produces a `Patch` that can later be applied
 * - `patch(oldValue, patch)` replays a patch against a value of the same domain
 * - `empty` is the identity patch: applying it should leave the value unchanged
 * - `combine(first, second)` composes patches in sequence, where `second`
 *   represents changes that happen after `first`
 * - Patch types are chosen by the differ implementation and may be compact,
 *   domain-specific, or compatible with a serialization format such as JSON
 *   Patch
 *
 * **Common tasks**
 *
 * - Construct a differ by providing the four operations of the {@link Differ}
 *   interface
 * - Compute a patch with `diff` when you have an old value and a new value
 * - Store, transmit, or aggregate patches instead of storing full replacement
 *   values
 * - Combine incremental updates with `combine` before applying them
 * - Apply updates with `patch` to reconstruct the next value from a previous
 *   value and a patch
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * - `combine` is order-sensitive for most patch formats
 * - A patch is generally meaningful only for values that belong to the same
 *   domain and assumptions used by the differ that created it
 * - Differs should make `empty` a true identity and should make combined

 * - May fail with an error of type `E`
 * - Requires a context/environment of type `R`
 *
 * Effects are lazy and immutable - they describe computations that can be executed later.

 * ## Key Features
 *
 * - **Type-safe error handling**: Errors are tracked in the type system
 * - **Resource management**: Automatic cleanup with scoped resources
 * - **Structured concurrency**: Safe parallel and concurrent execution
 * - **Composable**: Effects can be combined using operators like `flatMap`, `map`, `zip`

 * that can be yielded inside `Effect.gen`.
 *
 * **Mental model**
 *
 * - `Effectable` does not run effects by itself; it provides prototypes that
 *   implement the internal Effect protocol.
 * - {@link Prototype} creates a primitive Effect prototype with a custom
 *   evaluation function that receives the current `Fiber`.
 * - {@link Class} is an abstract base class for defining custom classes whose
 *   instances are also `Effect` values.
 * - The success, error, and service requirements of the custom type are
 *   preserved through the `Effect.Effect<A, E, R>` type parameters.
 *
 * **Common tasks**
 *
 * - Build an effect-like interface around a declarative data structure.
 * - Implement a custom `evaluate` hook that interprets the value in terms of
 *   the current fiber and returns the underlying `Effect`.
 * - Extend {@link Class} when a nominal class-based API is more convenient
 *   than manually wiring a prototype.
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * - This module is intentionally low-level; most application code should use

 * - `evaluate` must return an `Effect` with the same success, error, and

 * - Because these APIs participate in the internal Effect protocol, keep
 *   implementations small and follow existing modules such as `Config` and
 *   `Context` when adding new effect-like types.

/**
 * Structural and custom equality for Effect values.
 *
 * The `Equal` module provides deep structural comparison for primitives, plain
 * objects, arrays, Maps, Sets, Dates, and RegExps. Types that implement the
 * {@link Equal} interface can supply their own comparison logic while staying
 * compatible with the rest of the ecosystem (HashMap, HashSet, etc.).
 *
 * ## Mental model
 *
 * - **Structural equality** — two values are equal when their contents match,
 *   not when they share the same reference.
 * - **Hash-first shortcut** — before comparing fields, the module checks
 *   {@link Hash.hash}. If the hashes differ the objects are unequal without
 *   further traversal.
 * - **Equal interface** — any object that implements both {@link symbol} (the
 *   equality method) and `Hash.symbol` (the hash method) can define custom
 *   comparison logic.
 * - **Caching** — comparison results for object pairs are cached in a WeakMap.
 *   This makes repeated checks fast but **requires immutability** after the
 *   first comparison.
 * - **By-reference opt-out** — {@link byReference} and {@link byReferenceUnsafe}
 *   let you switch individual objects back to reference equality when you need
 *   mutable identity semantics.
 *
 * ## Common tasks
 *
 * - Compare two values → {@link equals}
 * - Check if a value implements `Equal` → {@link isEqual}
 * - Use `equals` where an `Equivalence` is expected → {@link asEquivalence}
 * - Implement custom equality on a class → implement {@link Equal} (see
 *   example on the interface)
 * - Opt an object out of structural equality → {@link byReference} /
 *   {@link byReferenceUnsafe}
 *
 * ## Gotchas
 *
 * - Objects **must be treated as immutable** after their first equality check.
 *   Results are cached; mutating an object afterwards yields stale results.
 * - `NaN` is considered equal to `NaN` (unlike `===`).
 * - Functions without an `Equal` implementation are compared by reference.
 * - Map and Set comparisons are order-independent but O(n²) in size.
 * - If only one of two objects implements `Equal`, they are never equal.
 *
 * ## Quickstart

 * **Example** (basic structural comparison)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Equal } from "effect"

 * - **Reflexive property**: Every value is equivalent to itself (`eq(a, a) === true`)
 * - **Symmetric property**: If `a` is equivalent to `b`, then `b` is equivalent to `a` (`eq(a, b) === eq(b, a)`)

 * - **Reference equality optimization**: {@link make} checks `===` first for performance before calling the custom function
 * - **Composition**: Equivalences can be combined using {@link combine} and {@link combineAll} to create more complex relations
 *
 * ## Common tasks
 *
 * - Creating custom equivalences → {@link make}
 * - Using strict equality (`===`) → {@link strictEqual}
 * - Combining multiple equivalences (AND logic) → {@link combine}, {@link combineAll}
 * - Transforming input before comparison → {@link mapInput}
 * - Creating equivalences for structured types → {@link Struct}, {@link Tuple}, {@link Array_}, {@link Record}
 *
 * ## Gotchas
 *
 * - `strictEqual` uses `===`, so `NaN !== NaN` and objects are compared by reference, not structure
 * - `make` optimizes with a reference equality check, so identical references return `true` without calling the function
 * - `combineAll` with an empty collection returns an equivalence that always returns `true`
 * - `Tuple` and `Array` require matching lengths; different lengths are never equivalent
 *
 * ## Quickstart
 *
 * **Example** (Case-insensitive string equivalence)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Array, Equivalence } from "effect"
 *
 * const caseInsensitive = Equivalence.make<string>((a, b) =>
 *   a.toLowerCase() === b.toLowerCase()
 * )
 *
 * const strings = ["Hello", "world", "HELLO", "World"]
 * const deduplicated = Array.dedupeWith(strings, caseInsensitive)
 * console.log(deduplicated) // ["Hello", "world"]
 * ```

/**
 * Pluggable error reporting for Effect programs.
 *
 * Reporting is triggered by `Effect.withErrorReporting`,
 * `ErrorReporter.report`, or built-in reporting boundaries in the HTTP and
 * RPC server modules.
 *
 * Each reporter receives a structured callback with the failing `Cause`, a
 * pretty-printed `Error`, severity, and any extra attributes attached to the
 * original error — making it straightforward to forward failures to Sentry,
 * Datadog, or a custom logging backend.
 *
 * Use the annotation symbols (`ignore`, `severity`, `attributes`) on your
 * error classes to control reporting behavior per-error.
 *
 * **Example** (Reporting errors with annotations)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Data, Effect, ErrorReporter } from "effect"
 *
 * // A reporter that logs to the console
 * const consoleReporter = ErrorReporter.make(({ error, severity }) => {
 *   console.error(`[${severity}]`, error.message)

/**
 * The `ExecutionPlan` module provides a way to describe ordered fallback
 * strategies for effects and streams that need different resources across
 * repeated attempts. An `ExecutionPlan` is a non-empty list of steps, where
 * each step supplies a `Context` or `Layer` and may control retries with an
 * attempt limit, a `Schedule`, or a `while` predicate.
 *
 * **Mental model**
 *
 * - A plan is evaluated step by step until the wrapped effect or stream
 *   succeeds, or until every step has been exhausted
 * - Each step provides the services used while that step is active
 * - `attempts` limits how many times a step may be tried
 * - `schedule` controls retry timing and receives the failure input
 * - `while` can stop retrying a step based on the failure input
 * - `CurrentMetadata` exposes the current 1-based attempt and 0-based step
 *   index to code running under a plan
 *
 * **Common tasks**
 *
 * - Build a plan with {@link make}
 * - Run an effect with a plan using `Effect.withExecutionPlan`
 * - Run a stream with a plan using `Stream.withExecutionPlan`
 * - Combine plans in order with {@link merge}
 * - Capture required services up front with `captureRequirements`
 * - Inspect the current attempt and step with {@link CurrentMetadata}

 * - Plans must contain at least one step
 * - `attempts` must be greater than zero when provided
 * - If `attempts` is omitted, a step is attempted once unless a `schedule` is
 *   provided
 * - A `while` predicate returning `false` skips the remaining retries for that

/**
 * Represents the outcome of an Effect computation as a plain, synchronously
 * inspectable value.
 *
 * ## Mental model
 *
 * - `Exit<A, E>` is a union of two cases: `Success<A, E>` and `Failure<A, E>`
 * - A `Success` wraps a value of type `A`
 * - A `Failure` wraps a `Cause<E>`, which may contain typed errors, defects, or interruptions
 * - `Exit` is also an `Effect`, so you can yield it directly inside `Effect.gen`
 * - Constructors mirror the failure modes: {@link fail} for typed errors, {@link die} for defects, {@link interrupt} for fiber interruptions
 * - Use `Exit` when you need to inspect an Effect result without running further effects
 *
 * ## Common tasks
 *
 * - Create a success: {@link succeed}
 * - Create a typed failure: {@link fail}
 * - Create a failure from a Cause: {@link failCause}
 * - Create a defect: {@link die}
 * - Create an interruption: {@link interrupt}
 * - Check the outcome: {@link isSuccess}, {@link isFailure}, {@link match}
 * - Extract values optionally: {@link getSuccess}, {@link getCause}, {@link findErrorOption}
 * - Transform the result: {@link map}, {@link mapError}, {@link mapBoth}
 * - Combine multiple exits: {@link asVoidAll}
 * - Inspect failure categories: {@link hasFails}, {@link hasDies}, {@link hasInterrupts}
 *
 * ## Gotchas
 *
 * - A `Failure` wraps a `Cause<E>`, not a bare `E`. Use Cause utilities to drill into it.
 * - {@link mapError} and {@link mapBoth} only transform typed errors (Fail reasons in the Cause). If the Cause contains only defects or interruptions, the original failure passes through unchanged.
 * - Filter-based APIs ({@link filterSuccess}, {@link filterValue}, etc.) return `Filter.fail` markers for pipeline composition. They are not `Option` values or Effect failures.
 * - {@link findError} and {@link findDefect} return only the first matching reason from the Cause.
 *
 * ## Quickstart
 *
 * **Example** (Creating and inspecting exits)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Exit } from "effect"
 *
 * const success = Exit.succeed(42)
 * const failure = Exit.fail("not found")
 *
 * const message = Exit.match(success, {

/**
 * This module provides utilities for working with `Fiber`, the fundamental unit of
 * concurrency in Effect. Fibers are lightweight, user-space threads that allow
 * multiple Effects to run concurrently with structured concurrency guarantees.
 *
 * Key characteristics of Fibers:
 * - **Lightweight**: Much lighter than OS threads, you can create millions
 * - **Structured concurrency**: Parent fibers manage child fiber lifecycles
 * - **Cancellation safety**: Proper resource cleanup when interrupted
 * - **Cooperative**: Fibers yield control at effect boundaries
 * - **Traceable**: Each fiber has an ID for debugging and monitoring
 *
 * Common patterns:
 * - **Fork and join**: Start concurrent work and wait for results
 * - **Race conditions**: Run multiple effects, take the first to complete
 * - **Supervision**: Monitor and restart failed fibers
 * - **Resource management**: Ensure proper cleanup on interruption
 *
 * **Example** (Running effects in fibers)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Console, Effect, Fiber } from "effect"
 *
 * // Basic fiber operations
 * const basicExample = Effect.gen(function*() {
 *   // Fork an effect to run concurrently

/**
 * The `FiberHandle` module provides a scoped handle for managing the lifecycle

 * `Fiber<A, E>`; when a new fiber is installed, the previous fiber is
 * interrupted unless the operation is configured with `onlyIfMissing`.
 *
 * **Mental model**
 *
 * - A handle is either open with zero or one current fiber, or closed by its
 *   surrounding `Scope`
 * - Closing the scope interrupts the current fiber and prevents new work from
 *   being accepted
 * - Completed fibers remove themselves from the handle, so the handle can be
 *   reused for later work
 * - Replacing a fiber uses the handle's internal interruption id, allowing
 *   expected replacement interruptions to be distinguished from real failures
 *
 * **Common tasks**
 *
 * - Create a scoped handle: {@link make}
 * - Fork an effect into the handle: {@link run}
 * - Store an existing fiber: {@link set}

 * - Use `onlyIfMissing` when a call should leave an already running fiber in
 *   place instead of replacing it
 * - `join` observes the handle's failure/close signal; successful fiber

 *
 * **Mental model**
 *
 * - A `FiberMap` is a keyed registry of fibers with lifecycle management
 * - Keys identify the currently active fiber for a logical task or resource
 * - Adding a fiber under an existing key interrupts the previous fiber by default
 * - Completed fibers remove themselves from the map if they are still current
 * - Closing the map's scope interrupts every fiber that remains in the map
 * - The map can surface the first non-ignored managed fiber failure via {@link join}

 *
 * - Create a scoped map: {@link make}

 * - Add existing fibers: {@link set}

 * owning `Scope` closes.
 *
 * **Mental model**
 *
 * - A `FiberSet` is an owned, scoped collection of fibers
 * - Fibers can be added directly with {@link add} / {@link addUnsafe}
 * - Effects can be forked into the set with {@link run}, {@link runtime}, or
 *   {@link runtimePromise}
 * - Completed fibers are automatically removed from the set
 * - Closing the scope or calling {@link clear} interrupts the currently tracked
 *   fibers
 * - {@link join} waits for the set's first non-ignored failure, while

/**
 * This module provides a comprehensive file system abstraction that supports both synchronous

 *
 * **Mental model**
 *
 * - A filter is a typed predicate that can also transform the successful value
 * - Predicate-based filters pass the original input when the predicate returns `true`
 * - Refinement-based filters narrow the successful type, for example from `unknown` to `string`

 * - Filters compose with logical and sequential combinators instead of throwing exceptions
 * - `FilterEffect` is the effectful form for filters that need asynchronous work, errors, or services

 *
 * - Create maps: {@link empty}, {@link make}, {@link fromIterable}

 * - Combine maps: {@link union}
 * - Iterate or convert: {@link keys}, {@link values}, {@link entries}, {@link toValues}, {@link toEntries}
 * - Transform values: {@link map}, {@link flatMap}, {@link filter}, {@link filterMap}, {@link compact}
 * - Fold and search: {@link reduce}, {@link findFirst}, {@link some}, {@link every}
 * - Batch updates efficiently: {@link mutate}, {@link beginMutation}, {@link endMutation}
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * - {@link getUnsafe} throws when the key is absent; prefer {@link get} unless
 *   absence is impossible by construction
 * - Mutating a key object after insertion can make future lookups fail if its
 *   equality or hash changes
 * - Hash collisions are handled by equality checks, so matching hashes alone do
 *   not make two keys equal
 * - Use {@link getHash} and {@link hasHash} only when you already have the
 *   correct hash for the same key
 * - Convert entries to an array and sort them when deterministic presentation is
 *   required

/**
 * The `HashRing` module provides a weighted consistent-hashing data structure

 * minimizes remapping when nodes are added, removed, or reweighted, which makes
 * it useful for routing requests, partitioning keys, and distributing shards
 * across service instances or storage backends.
 *
 * **Mental model**
 *
 * - Each node is identified by its {@link PrimaryKey.PrimaryKey} value
 * - {@link add} and {@link addMany} place weighted virtual points on the ring
 * - {@link get} hashes an input string and returns the nearest node on the ring
 * - {@link getShards} assigns a fixed number of shard indexes across the nodes
 * - Higher weights receive proportionally more virtual points and shard
 *   allocations
 * - Operations mutate and return the same ring instance
 *
 * **Common tasks**
 *
 * - Create an empty ring: {@link make}
 * - Add or update nodes: {@link add}, {@link addMany}
 * - Remove nodes: {@link remove}
 * - Check membership by primary key: {@link has}
 * - Route an input key to a node: {@link get}
 * - Precompute shard ownership: {@link getShards}
 * - Guard unknown values: {@link isHashRing}
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * - Empty rings return `undefined` from {@link get} and {@link getShards}
 * - Nodes with the same primary key represent the same ring member
 * - Weights are clamped to a positive minimum so a node remains represented
 * - Mutating a ring in place is intentional; create a new ring when independent
 *   snapshots are required

 * as determined by Effect's `Equal` / `Hash` semantics.
 *
 * **Mental model**
 *
 * - `HashSet<A>` is an immutable collection of unique values of type `A`
 * - Operations such as {@link add}, {@link remove}, {@link union}, and

 * - Membership is checked with {@link has}, using Effect equality and hashing

 * - Test values: {@link some}, {@link every}
 * - Fold values: {@link reduce}
 *
 * **Gotchas**

 * - Values that should compare structurally should implement compatible
 *   `Equal` and `Hash` behavior; otherwise object identity may affect whether
 *   values are considered distinct
 * - {@link map} may reduce the set size when multiple input values map to the

/**
 * This module provides utilities for Higher-Kinded Types (HKT) in TypeScript.
 *
 * Higher-Kinded Types are types that take other types as parameters, similar to how
 * functions take values as parameters. They enable generic programming over type
 * constructors, allowing you to write code that works with any container type
 * (like Array, Option, Effect, etc.) in a uniform way.
 *
 * The HKT system in Effect uses TypeLambdas to encode type-level functions that
 * can represent complex type relationships with multiple type parameters, including
 * contravariant, covariant, and invariant positions.
 *
 * **Example** (Encoding type lambdas)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import type { HKT } from "effect"
 *
 * // Define a TypeLambda for Array
 * interface ArrayTypeLambda extends HKT.TypeLambda {
 *   readonly type: Array<this["Target"]>
 * }
 *
 * // Use Kind to get the concrete type
 * type MyArray = HKT.Kind<ArrayTypeLambda, never, never, never, string>
 * // MyArray is Array<string>

/**
 * JSON Patch operations for transforming JSON documents.
 *
 * This module implements a subset of RFC 6902, providing operations that can be applied deterministically without additional context. It supports computing structural diffs between JSON values and applying patches to transform documents.
 *
 * ## Mental model
 *
 * - **JSON Patch**: An ordered sequence of operations that transform a document from one state to another
 * - **JSON Pointer**: Path syntax for targeting specific locations in a JSON document (e.g., `/users/0/name`)
 * - **Operations**: Three types - `add` (insert value), `remove` (delete value), `replace` (update value)
 * - **Immutable transformations**: All operations return new values; inputs are never mutated
 * - **Sequential application**: Operations are applied in order, with later operations observing changes from earlier ones
 * - **Structural diff**: The `get` function computes differences by comparing structure, not content semantics
 *
 * ## Common tasks
 *
 * - Computing diffs between JSON values → {@link get}
 * - Applying patches to transform documents → {@link apply}
 * - Creating patches manually → {@link JsonPatchOperation}
 * - Storing and validating patch documents → {@link JsonPatch}
 *
 * ## Gotchas
 *
 * - Array removals are emitted from highest index to lowest to avoid index shifting during application
 * - Root operations use an empty string path `""` to target the entire document
 * - Array append operations use `-` as the last token in the path (e.g., `/items/-`)
 * - Generated patches are deterministic but not guaranteed to be minimal
 * - Empty patches return the original document reference (no allocation)
 * - Invalid paths or operations throw errors rather than returning a result type
 *
 * ## Quickstart
 *
 * **Example** (Computing and applying a patch)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import * as JsonPatch from "effect/JsonPatch"
 *
 * const oldValue = { name: "Alice", age: 30 }
 * const newValue = { name: "Alice", age: 31, city: "NYC" }

/**
 * Utilities for escaping and unescaping JSON Pointer reference tokens according to RFC 6901.
 *
 * JSON Pointer (RFC 6901) defines a string syntax for identifying a specific value within a JSON document.
 * A JSON Pointer is a sequence of reference tokens separated by forward slashes (`/`). Each reference token
 * must be escaped when it contains special characters (`~` or `/`).
 *
 * ## Mental model
 *
 * - **Reference token**: A single segment of a JSON Pointer path (e.g., `"foo"`, `"bar/baz"`, `"key~with~tilde"`)
 * - **Escaping**: Encoding special characters in a token so it can be safely used in a JSON Pointer (`~` → `~0`, `/` → `~1`)
 * - **Unescaping**: Decoding escaped characters back to their original form (`~0` → `~`, `~1` → `/`)
 * - **RFC 6901 compliance**: These functions implement the standard escaping rules for JSON Pointer reference tokens
 * - **Pure functions**: Both operations are pure, immutable, and have no side effects
 *
 * ## Common tasks
 *
 * - Building JSON Pointers from path segments → {@link escapeToken}
 * - Parsing JSON Pointers to extract original token values → {@link unescapeToken}
 * - Escaping object keys or path segments before constructing JSON Pointers → {@link escapeToken}
 * - Extracting unescaped identifiers from JSON Pointer strings → {@link unescapeToken}
 *
 * ## Gotchas
 *
 * - These functions operate on **reference tokens**, not full JSON Pointers. A full JSON Pointer like `/foo/bar` must be split into tokens (`["foo", "bar"]`) before escaping/unescaping
 * - The order of replacement operations matters: `escapeToken` replaces `~` before `/` to avoid double-escaping
 * - Empty strings are valid tokens and are returned unchanged
 * - These functions do not validate JSON Pointer syntax; they only handle token-level escaping
 *
 * ## Quickstart
 *
 * **Example** (Building and parsing a JSON Pointer)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { escapeToken, unescapeToken } from "effect/JsonPointer"
 *
 * // Build a JSON Pointer from path segments
 * const segments = ["users", "name/alias", "value"]
 * const pointer = "/" + segments.map(escapeToken).join("/")
 * // "/users/name~1alias/value"
 *
 * // Parse a JSON Pointer back to segments

 * // ["users", "name/alias", "value"]

/**
 * Convert JSON Schema documents between dialects (Draft-07, Draft-2020-12,

 * an output dialect.
 *
 * ## Mental model
 *
 * - **JsonSchema** — a plain object with string keys; represents any single
 *   JSON Schema node.
 * - **Dialect** — one of `"draft-07"`, `"draft-2020-12"`, `"openapi-3.1"`,
 *   or `"openapi-3.0"`.
 * - **Document** — a structured container holding a root `schema`, its
 *   companion `definitions`, and the target `dialect`. Definitions are
 *   stored separately from the root schema so they can be relocated when
 *   converting between dialects.
 * - **MultiDocument** — same as `Document` but carries multiple root
 *   schemas (at least one). Useful when generating several schemas that
 *   share a single definitions pool.
 * - **Definitions** — a `Record<string, JsonSchema>` keyed by definition
 *   name. The ref pointer prefix depends on the dialect.
 * - **`from*` functions** — parse a raw JSON Schema object into the
 *   canonical `Document<"draft-2020-12">`.
 * - **`to*` functions** — convert from the canonical representation to a
 *   specific output dialect.
 *
 * ## Common tasks
 *
 * - Parse a Draft-07 schema → {@link fromSchemaDraft07}
 * - Parse a Draft-2020-12 schema → {@link fromSchemaDraft2020_12}
 * - Parse an OpenAPI 3.1 schema → {@link fromSchemaOpenApi3_1}
 * - Parse an OpenAPI 3.0 schema → {@link fromSchemaOpenApi3_0}
 * - Convert to Draft-07 output → {@link toDocumentDraft07}
 * - Convert to OpenAPI 3.1 output → {@link toMultiDocumentOpenApi3_1}
 * - Resolve a `$ref` against definitions → {@link resolve$ref}
 * - Inline the root `$ref` of a document → {@link resolveTopLevel$ref}
 *
 * ## Gotchas
 *
 * - All `from*` functions normalize to `Document<"draft-2020-12">`
 *   regardless of the input dialect.
 * - Unsupported or unrecognized JSON Schema keywords are silently dropped
 *   during conversion.
 * - Draft-07 tuple syntax (`items` as array + `additionalItems`) is
 *   converted to 2020-12 form (`prefixItems` + `items`), and vice-versa.
 * - OpenAPI 3.0 `nullable: true` is expanded into `type` arrays or
 *   `anyOf` unions. The `nullable` keyword is removed.
 * - OpenAPI 3.0 singular `example` is converted to `examples` (array).
 * - {@link resolve$ref} only looks up the last segment of the ref path in
 *   the definitions map; it does not follow arbitrary JSON Pointer paths.
 *
 * ## Quickstart
 *
 * **Example** (Parse a Draft-07 schema and convert to Draft-07 output)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { JsonSchema } from "effect"
 *

 * - An open latch lets current and future waiters continue immediately
 * - A closed latch causes `await` and `whenOpen` to suspend
 * - {@link open} permanently opens the latch until it is closed again

 *
 * **Mental model**

 * - `contextEffect` requires a `Scope.Scope` because it exposes the acquired context directly
 * - `get` returns a `Layer` that can be provided to programs expecting the keyed services

/**
 * The `Logger` module defines the logging model used by the Effect runtime and

 * {@link Options} value and transforms it into an output such as a string,
 * structured object, JSON line, console write, file write, or trace span event.
 *
 * **Mental model**
 *
 * - Effect programs emit log events with APIs such as `Effect.log`,
 *   `Effect.logInfo`, `Effect.logWarning`, and `Effect.logError`
 * - Each event contains a message, log level, cause, fiber, and timestamp
 * - Loggers are ordinary values created with {@link make} and installed with
 *   {@link layer}
 * - Multiple loggers can be active at once by providing a layer with several
 *   logger values
 * - Formatter loggers such as {@link formatLogFmt}, {@link formatStructured},
 *   and {@link formatJson} return formatted data without writing it anywhere
 * - Console loggers such as {@link consolePretty}, {@link consoleLogFmt},
 *   {@link consoleStructured}, and {@link consoleJson} write formatted output
 *   to the active Effect console
 *
 * **Log output structure**
 *
 * Built-in formatters include the log level, timestamp, fiber identifier, and
 * logged message. When present, they also include the pretty-printed cause,
 * active log annotations, and active log spans. Structured and JSON loggers keep
 * these fields as machine-readable data, while logfmt and pretty loggers render
 * them as human-readable text.
 *
 * **Common tasks**
 *
 * - Create a custom logger: {@link make}
 * - Transform logger output: {@link map}
 * - Write formatter output to the console: {@link withConsoleLog},
 *   {@link withConsoleError}, {@link withLeveledConsole}
 * - Use built-in console loggers: {@link consolePretty}, {@link consoleLogFmt},
 *   {@link consoleStructured}, {@link consoleJson}
 * - Use built-in formatter loggers: {@link formatSimple}, {@link formatLogFmt},
 *   {@link formatStructured}, {@link formatJson}
 * - Batch logger output before flushing to a sink: {@link batched}
 * - Write string logger output to a file: {@link toFile}
 * - Preserve trace correlation by including {@link tracerLogger}
 * - Install or replace loggers for an effect: {@link layer}
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * - {@link layer} replaces the current logger set by default; pass
 *   `mergeWithExisting: true` when adding loggers to the existing runtime
 *   loggers
 * - Formatter loggers only produce values; wrap them with console, file, batch,
 *   or custom sink loggers when output should be written somewhere
 * - {@link batched} and {@link toFile} are scoped; keep their scope open while
 *   logs are being emitted so buffered entries can flush reliably
 * - {@link toFile} accepts only loggers that output strings, so pair it with
 *   string formatters such as {@link formatJson} or {@link formatLogFmt}
 * - The default runtime logger set includes {@link tracerLogger}; replacing
 *   loggers without merging may remove automatic log-to-trace-span recording

/**
 * The `LogLevel` module defines the levels used by Effect logging and the

/**
 * The `ManagedRuntime` module provides a way to build a reusable runtime from
 * a `Layer` and use it to run effects that require the services produced by
 * that layer. A `ManagedRuntime<R, ER>` owns the lifecycle of the layer-built
 * resources, caches the resulting `Context<R>`, and exposes runners for
 * integrating Effect programs with JavaScript entry points.
 *
 * **Mental model**
 *
 * - A managed runtime is created from a `Layer` with {@link make}
 * - The layer is built lazily the first time the runtime is used
 * - The built context is cached and reused for subsequent effect executions
 * - Resources acquired by the layer are owned by the runtime's internal scope
 * - Disposing the runtime closes that scope and releases all managed resources
 * - Effects run through the runtime receive the layer's services automatically
 *
 * **Common tasks**
 *
 * - Create a runtime from application services: {@link make}
 * - Run an effect as a `Promise`: {@link ManagedRuntime.runPromise}
 * - Run an effect and keep its `Exit`: {@link ManagedRuntime.runPromiseExit}
 * - Fork an effect into a `Fiber`: {@link ManagedRuntime.runFork}
 * - Bridge callback-style APIs: {@link ManagedRuntime.runCallback}
 * - Run synchronous effects at program boundaries: {@link ManagedRuntime.runSync},
 *   {@link ManagedRuntime.runSyncExit}
 * - Access the cached service context: {@link ManagedRuntime.context}
 * - Release layer resources: {@link ManagedRuntime.dispose},
 *   {@link ManagedRuntime.disposeEffect}
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * - Always dispose a managed runtime when it is no longer needed, especially
 *   when the layer acquires resources such as connections, servers, or files
 * - Layer construction errors are included in the error channel of runtime
 *   runners, so `ER` is combined with the effect's own error type
 * - `runSync` can only execute effects without asynchronous boundaries; use
 *   `runPromise` for asynchronous programs
 * - After disposal, the runtime cannot be reused

/**
 * The `effect/match` module provides a type-safe pattern matching system for
 * TypeScript. Inspired by functional programming, it simplifies conditional
 * logic by replacing verbose if/else or switch statements with a structured and
 * expressive API.
 *
 * This module supports matching against types, values, and discriminated unions
 * while enforcing exhaustiveness checking to ensure all cases are handled.
 *
 * Although pattern matching is not yet a native JavaScript feature,
 * `effect/match` offers a reliable implementation that is available today.
 *
 * **How Pattern Matching Works**
 *
 * Pattern matching follows a structured process:
 *
 * - **Creating a matcher**: Define a `Matcher` that operates on either a
 *   specific `Match.type` or `Match.value`.
 *
 * - **Defining patterns**: Use combinators such as `Match.when`, `Match.not`,
 *   and `Match.tag` to specify matching conditions.
 *
 * - **Completing the match**: Apply a finalizer such as `Match.exhaustive`,
 *   `Match.orElse`, or `Match.option` to determine how unmatched cases should
 *   be handled.

/**
 * The `Metric` module provides tools for defining, updating, tagging, and
 * reading application metrics from Effect programs. A `Metric<Input, State>`
 * accepts typed input values and aggregates them into a typed state that can be
 * read directly or exported from a snapshot.
 *
 * **Mental model**
 *
 * - A metric has an identifier, a type, an optional description, optional attributes, and mutable aggregate state
 * - Use counters for cumulative values such as requests, errors, retries, or bytes processed
 * - Use gauges for point-in-time values that can rise or fall, such as active connections or queue size
 * - Use frequencies to count occurrences of discrete string values, such as status codes or action names
 * - Use histograms to bucket numeric observations and inspect count, min, max, and sum
 * - Use summaries to calculate quantiles over a bounded, time-based observation window
 * - Metrics are updated from effects with {@link update} and {@link modify}, and read with {@link value}
 * - Attributes tag metrics with key-value dimensions so the same logical metric can be grouped by service, endpoint, method, or other labels
 * - Snapshots capture the currently registered metrics and their aggregate states for reporting or export
 *
 * **Common tasks**
 *
 * - Create counters: {@link counter}
 * - Create gauges: {@link gauge}
 * - Create frequencies: {@link frequency}
 * - Create histograms: {@link histogram}, {@link linearBoundaries}, {@link exponentialBoundaries}
 * - Create summaries: {@link summary}, {@link summaryWithTimestamp}
 * - Measure effect duration: {@link timer}
 * - Update a metric: {@link update}
 * - Apply relative updates where supported: {@link modify}
 * - Read one metric: {@link value}
 * - Tag a metric: {@link withAttributes}
 * - Transform accepted input values: {@link mapInput}
 * - Record a constant input for repeated events: {@link withConstantInput}
 * - Inspect all registered metrics: {@link snapshot}, {@link dump}
 * - Enable fiber runtime metrics: {@link enableRuntimeMetrics}
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * - Counter and gauge metrics can use `number` inputs by default or `bigint` inputs with the `bigint` option
 * - Incremental counters ignore negative updates; use non-incremental counters only when decreases are meaningful
 * - {@link update} sets a gauge to an absolute value, while {@link modify} changes it relative to its current value
 * - Histogram buckets are cumulative and depend on the boundaries supplied when the metric is created
 * - Summary quantiles are calculated from the configured sliding window, so old observations expire
 * - Prefer low-cardinality attributes; using unbounded values such as request IDs can create too many metric series
 *
 * **Quickstart**
 *
 * **Example** (Creating and updating metrics)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect, Metric } from "effect"
 *
 * const requestCount = Metric.counter("http_requests_total", {
 *   description: "Total number of HTTP requests"
 * })
 *
 * const responseTime = Metric.histogram("http_response_time", {
 *   description: "HTTP response time in milliseconds",
 *   boundaries: Metric.linearBoundaries({ start: 0, width: 50, count: 20 })
 * })
 *
 * const handleRequest = Effect.gen(function*() {
 *   yield* Metric.update(

/**
 * The `MutableHashSet` module provides a mutable hash set for storing unique
 * values with efficient membership checks, insertion, removal, and iteration.
 * It is built on {@link MutableHashMap}: each set value is stored as a map key,
 * so uniqueness follows the same hashing and equality rules as the underlying
 * mutable hash map.
 *
 * **Mental model**
 *
 * - `MutableHashSet<V>` is a mutable collection of unique values of type `V`
 * - Operations such as {@link add}, {@link remove}, and {@link clear} mutate
 *   the set in place
 * - Duplicate values are ignored according to Effect equality and hashing semantics
 * - Values that implement `Equal` / `Hash` are compared structurally
 * - Primitive values and references that do not implement Effect equality use
 *   the normal hash map behavior
 * - The set is iterable, so `Array.from(set)` or `for...of` can be used to
 *   inspect its values
 *
 * **Common tasks**
 *
 * - Create an empty set: {@link empty}
 * - Create from values: {@link make}
 * - Create from any iterable: {@link fromIterable}
 * - Add a value: {@link add}
 * - Check membership: {@link has}
 * - Remove a value: {@link remove}
 * - Remove all values: {@link clear}
 * - Count unique values: {@link size}
 * - Narrow unknown values: {@link isMutableHashSet}
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * - This data structure is intentionally mutable; keep ownership clear when
 *   sharing it between callers
 * - Mutating operations return the same set instance for convenient piping, not
 *   a copy
 * - Iteration order should not be used as a stable sorting mechanism
 * - For immutable set operations, use Effect's immutable collection modules
 *   instead
 *
 * **Performance**
 *
 * - Add, membership checks, and removal are O(1) on average and O(n) in the

 * - Clearing and reading the size are O(1)
 * - Iteration is O(n)

/**
 * The `MutableList` module provides a mutable linked list for accumulating,

 *
 * A `MutableList<A>` stores values in linked buckets of arrays. Appending adds
 * values to the tail, prepending adds values to the head, and taking removes
 * values from the head. Unlike persistent collections, every mutation updates
 * the list object in place: operations such as {@link append}, {@link prepend},
 * {@link take}, {@link takeN}, {@link clear}, {@link filter}, and {@link remove}
 * change the same `MutableList` instance and update its `length`.
 *
 * **Mental model**
 *
 * - `MutableList<A>` is a stateful container with `head`, `tail`, and `length`
 * - Values are consumed from the head with {@link take}, {@link takeN}, or
 *   {@link takeAll}
 * - {@link append} and {@link appendAll} preserve FIFO queue order for normal
 *   producer-consumer use cases
 * - {@link prepend} and {@link prependAll} place values before the current
 *   contents, which is useful for priority work or restoring items to the front
 * - {@link toArray} and {@link toArrayN} copy values without modifying the list
 * - The `head` and `tail` bucket fields are exposed for advanced use, but most
 *   code should treat them as implementation details
 *
 * **Common tasks**
 *
 * - Create an empty list: {@link make}
 * - Add one value: {@link append}, {@link prepend}
 * - Add many values: {@link appendAll}, {@link prependAll}
 * - Drain one value: {@link take}
 * - Drain many values: {@link takeN}, {@link takeAll}
 * - Inspect without draining: {@link toArrayN}, {@link toArray}
 * - Reset the list: {@link clear}
 * - Mutate contents in place: {@link filter}, {@link remove}
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * - `MutableList` is intentionally mutable; sharing a list means sharing its
 *   changing state
 * - {@link take} returns the {@link Empty} symbol when the list has no value, so

 * - {@link appendAllUnsafe} and {@link prependAllUnsafe} may reuse the provided

 *
 * **Mental model**
 *
 * - `MutableRef<A>` is a stable reference whose `.current` field may change over time
 * - Reads and writes are synchronous and return immediately
 * - `set`, `update`, `increment`, `decrement`, and `toggle` mutate the same reference in place
 * - `getAnd*` helpers return the previous value, while `*AndGet` helpers return the new value
 * - `compareAndSet` updates only when the current value is equal to the expected value using `Equal.equals`

/**
 * Lightweight wrapper types that prevent accidental mixing of structurally

 *
 * **Mental model**
 *
 * - **Newtype** — a compile-time wrapper around a **carrier** type (the
 *   underlying primitive or object). At runtime the value is unchanged; the
 *   tag exists only in the type system.
 * - **Key** — a unique string literal that distinguishes one newtype from
 *   another (e.g. `"Label"`, `"UserId"`).
 * - **Carrier** — the underlying type the newtype wraps (e.g. `string`,
 *   `number`).
 * - **Iso** — a lossless two-way conversion between a newtype and its carrier,
 *   created with {@link makeIso}. Use `iso.set(carrier)` to wrap and
 *   `iso.get(newtype)` to unwrap.
 *
 * **Common tasks**
 *
 * - Define a newtype → declare an `interface` extending
 *   `Newtype.Newtype<Key, Carrier>`
 * - Wrap / unwrap values → {@link makeIso} (returns an `Optic.Iso`)

 * - Lift an `Order` → {@link makeOrder}
 * - Lift a `Combiner` → {@link makeCombiner}
 * - Lift a `Reducer` → {@link makeReducer}
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * - Newtypes are **purely compile-time**. There is zero runtime overhead;
 *   `value` and `makeIso` use identity casts.
 * - Two newtypes sharing the same key string will be assignable to each other.
 *   Choose unique key strings.
 * - A newtype value is **not** assignable to its carrier type without
 *   explicitly unwrapping via {@link value} or an iso.

 * **Quickstart**
 *
 * **Example** (defining and using a newtype)

/**
 * The `NonEmptyIterable` module provides a type-level representation of any
 * JavaScript `Iterable` that is known to contain at least one element. A
 * `NonEmptyIterable<A>` can be consumed anywhere an `Iterable<A>` is expected,
 * while also carrying the guarantee that reading the first element is safe.
 *
 * **Mental model**
 *
 * - `NonEmptyIterable<A>` is an `Iterable<A>` branded with a non-empty guarantee
 * - The guarantee is static: values should only be typed this way when construction or validation proves at least one element exists
 * - The iterable can be an array, string, set, map, generator, or any custom iterable
 * - `unprepend` safely separates the first element from an iterator for the remaining elements
 * - Operations that may remove elements, such as filtering, usually return ordinary collections because they can become empty
 *
 * **Common tasks**
 *
 * - Accept inputs that must contain at least one value
 * - Extract a head element and process the remaining iterator with {@link unprepend}
 * - Model APIs such as reductions, comparisons, or aggregation that are undefined for empty inputs
 * - Preserve compatibility with the JavaScript iteration protocol while documenting the stronger invariant
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * - A type assertion does not make an empty iterable non-empty; only assert after a trusted check or constructor
 * - Iterators are stateful, so calling {@link unprepend} consumes the first yielded value from that iterator
 * - The order of the first element follows the source iterable's iteration order, for example insertion order for `Map` and `Set`
 * - Some transformations preserve non-emptiness, but transformations that can discard elements must account for the empty case
 *
 * **Quickstart**
 *
 * **Example** (Requiring a non-empty iterable)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import * as NonEmptyIterable from "effect/NonEmptyIterable"
 *
 * // NonEmptyIterable is a type that represents any iterable with at least one element
 * function processNonEmpty<A>(data: NonEmptyIterable.NonEmptyIterable<A>): A {
 *   // Safe to get the first element - guaranteed to exist
 *   const [first] = NonEmptyIterable.unprepend(data)
 *   return first
 * }

 * ]) as unknown as NonEmptyIterable.NonEmptyIterable<[string, string]>
 * const [firstEntry] = NonEmptyIterable.unprepend(nonEmptyMap)

 * // Custom generator functions
 * function* fibonacci(): NonEmptyIterable.NonEmptyIterable<number> {
 *   let a = 1, b = 1
 *   yield a
 *   while (true) {
 *     yield b

/**
 * Composable, immutable accessors for reading and updating nested data
 * structures without mutation.
 *
 * **Mental model**
 *
 * - **Optic** — a first-class reference to a piece inside a larger structure.
 *   Compose optics to reach deeply nested values.
 * - **Iso** — lossless two-way conversion (`get`/`set`) between `S` and `A`.
 *   Extends both {@link Lens} and {@link Prism}.
 * - **Lens** — focuses on exactly one part of `S`. `get` always succeeds;
 *   `replace` needs the original `S` to produce the updated whole.
 * - **Prism** — focuses on a part that may not be present (e.g. a union
 *   variant). `getResult` can fail; `set` builds a new `S` from `A` alone.
 * - **Optional** — the most general optic: both reading and writing can fail.
 * - **Traversal** — focuses on zero or more elements of an array-like
 *   structure. Technically `Optional<S, ReadonlyArray<A>>`.
 * - **Hierarchy** (strongest → weakest):
 *   `Iso > Lens | Prism > Optional`. Composing a weaker optic with any other
 *   produces the weaker kind.
 *
 * **Common tasks**
 *
 * - Start a chain → {@link id} (identity iso)
 * - Drill into a struct key → `.key("name")` / `.optionalKey("name")`
 * - Drill into a key that may not exist → `.at("name")`
 * - Narrow a tagged union → `.tag("MyVariant")`
 * - Narrow by type guard → `.refine(guard)`
 * - Add validation → `.check(Schema.isGreaterThan(0))`
 * - Filter out `undefined` → `.notUndefined()`
 * - Pick/omit struct keys → `.pick(["a","b"])` / `.omit(["c"])`
 * - Traverse array elements → `.forEach(el => el.key("field"))`
 * - Build an iso → {@link makeIso}
 * - Build a lens → {@link makeLens}
 * - Build a prism → {@link makePrism}, {@link fromChecks}
 * - Build an optional → {@link makeOptional}
 * - Focus into `Option.Some` → {@link some}
 * - Focus into `Result.Success`/`Failure` → {@link success}, {@link failure}
 * - Convert record ↔ entries → {@link entries}
 * - Extract all traversal elements → {@link getAll}
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * - Updates are structurally persistent: only nodes on the path are cloned.
 *   Unrelated branches keep referential identity. However, **no-op updates
 *   may still allocate** a new root — do not rely on reference identity to
 *   detect no-ops.
 * - `replace` silently returns the original `S` when the optic cannot focus
 *   (e.g. wrong tag). Use `replaceResult` for explicit failure.
 * - `modify` also returns the original `S` on focus failure — it never throws.
 * - `.key()` and `.optionalKey()` do not work on union types (compile error).
 * - Only plain objects (`Object.prototype` or `null` prototype) and arrays can
 *   be cloned. Class instances cause a runtime error on `replace`/`modify`.

 * - `None` represents the absence of a value (like `null`/`undefined`, but type-safe)
 * - `Some<A>` wraps a present value of type `A`, accessed via `.value`
 * - `Option` is a monad: chain operations with {@link flatMap}, compose pipelines with `pipe`
 * - All operations are pure and return new `Option` values; the input is never mutated
 * - `Option` is yieldable in `Effect.gen`, producing the inner value or short-circuiting with `NoSuchElementError`
 *
 * **Common tasks**
 *
 * - Create from a value: {@link some}, {@link none}

 * - Check contents: {@link isSome}, {@link isNone}, {@link contains}, {@link exists}
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * - `Option.some(null)` is a valid `Some`; use {@link fromNullishOr} to treat `null`/`undefined` as `None`
 * - {@link filterMap} uses a `Filter` callback that returns `Result`
 * - {@link getOrThrow} throws a generic `Error`; prefer {@link getOrThrowWith} for custom errors
 * - `None` is a singleton; compare with {@link isNone}, not `===`
 * - When yielded in `Effect.gen`, a `None` becomes a `NoSuchElementError` defect
 *
 * **Quickstart**
 *
 * **Example** (Working with optional values)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Option } from "effect"
 *
 * const name = Option.some("Alice")

/**
 * This module provides the `Order` type class for defining total orderings on types.
 * An `Order` is a comparison function that returns `-1` (less than), `0` (equal), or `1` (greater than).
 *
 * Mental model:
 * - An `Order<A>` is a pure function `(a: A, b: A) => Ordering` that compares two values
 * - The result `-1` means the first value is less than the second
 * - The result `0` means the values are equal according to this ordering
 * - The result `1` means the first value is greater than the second
 * - Orders must satisfy total ordering laws: totality (either `x <= y` or `y <= x`), antisymmetry (if `x <= y` and `y <= x` then `x == y`), and transitivity (if `x <= y` and `y <= z` then `x <= z`)
 * - Orders can be composed using {@link combine} and {@link combineAll} to create multi-criteria comparisons
 * - Orders can be transformed using {@link mapInput} to compare values by extracting a comparable property
 * - Built-in orders exist for common types: {@link Number}, {@link String}, {@link Boolean}, {@link BigInt}, {@link Date}
 *
 * Common tasks:
 * - Creating custom orders → {@link make}
 * - Using built-in orders → {@link Number}, {@link String}, {@link Boolean}, {@link BigInt}, {@link Date}
 * - Combining multiple orders → {@link combine}, {@link combineAll}
 * - Transforming orders → {@link mapInput}
 * - Comparing values → {@link isLessThan}, {@link isGreaterThan}, {@link isLessThanOrEqualTo}, {@link isGreaterThanOrEqualTo}
 * - Finding min/max → {@link min}, {@link max}
 * - Clamping values → {@link clamp}, {@link isBetween}
 * - Ordering collections → {@link Array}, {@link Tuple}, {@link Struct}
 *
 * Gotchas:
 * - `Order.Number` treats all `NaN` values as equal and less than any other number
 * - `Order.make` uses reference equality (`===`) as a shortcut: if `self === that`, it returns `0` without calling the comparison function
 * - `Order.Array` compares arrays element-by-element, then by length if all elements are equal; `Order.all` only compares elements up to the shorter array's length
 * - `Order.Tuple` requires a fixed-length tuple with matching order types; `Order.Array` works with variable-length arrays
 * - `Order.min` and `Order.max` return the first argument when values are equal
 *
 * Quickstart:
 *
 * **Example** (Basic Usage)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Order } from "effect"
 *
 * const result = Order.Number(5, 10)
 * console.log(result) // -1 (5 is less than 10)
 *
 * const isLessThan = Order.isLessThan(Order.Number)(5, 10)
 * console.log(isLessThan) // true

/**
 * The `Ordering` module provides the standard representation for the result of
 * comparing two values. An `Ordering` is one of three numeric literals: `-1`
 * when the first value is less than the second, `0` when both values compare as
 * equal, and `1` when the first value is greater than the second.
 *
 * **Mental model**
 *
 * - `Ordering` describes the relationship between two compared values, not the
 *   values themselves
 * - Negative means "less than", zero means "equal", and positive means "greater
 *   than"
 * - Unlike JavaScript comparators, this type is normalized to exactly `-1`, `0`,
 *   or `1`
 * - `0` is neutral when combining comparisons; the first non-zero ordering
 *   determines the result

 * - Interpret a comparison result with {@link match}
 * - Reverse ascending and descending order with {@link reverse}
 * - Combine multiple comparison criteria with {@link Reducer}
 * - Build custom comparison functions for sorting, ordered collections, and

 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * - Do not cast arbitrary comparator results such as `a.localeCompare(b)`
 *   directly unless they have been normalized to `-1`, `0`, or `1`
 * - In comparator-style APIs, `-1` means the left value should come before the

/**
 * The `PartitionedSemaphore` module provides a semaphore for limiting

 * groups of work compete for the same bounded resource and each group should
 * make progress without one busy group monopolizing released permits.
 *
 * **Mental model**
 *
 * - The semaphore has a fixed shared capacity measured in permits
 * - Work acquires permits with a partition key of type `K`
 * - Waiting acquisitions are tracked per partition
 * - Released permits are assigned to waiting partitions in round-robin order
 * - `withPermit` and `withPermits` acquire permits around an effect and
 *   release them when the effect exits, fails, or is interrupted

 * **Common tasks**
 *
 * - Create a semaphore: {@link make}, {@link makeUnsafe}

 * - Limit a single operation per partition: {@link withPermit}
 * - Limit weighted work per partition: {@link withPermits}
 * - Run only when permits are immediately available:
 *   {@link withPermitsIfAvailable}
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * - `withPermitsIfAvailable` does not use a partition key; it only succeeds
 *   when the shared pool has enough permits immediately
 * - Acquiring more permits than the semaphore capacity never completes
 * - Requests for zero or negative permits complete without acquiring anything

/**
 * The `Path` module provides a platform path service for manipulating file
 * system paths through Effect's environment. It models path operations as a
 * replaceable service so programs can depend on path behavior without directly
 * coupling to a particular runtime implementation.
 *
 * **Mental model**
 *
 * - `Path.Path` is a `Context.Service` tag used to access the current path implementation
 * - The service offers familiar path operations such as joining, resolving, parsing, and formatting
 * - Most operations are pure string transformations and follow POSIX-style path semantics
 * - File URL conversions return `Effect`s because invalid paths or URLs can fail with `BadArgument`
 * - Custom implementations can be provided with `Layer.succeed` for alternate platforms or tests
 *
 * **Common tasks**
 *
 * - Combine path segments with `join` or turn segments into an absolute path with `resolve`
 * - Normalize `.` and `..` segments with `normalize`
 * - Inspect paths with `basename`, `dirname`, `extname`, and `isAbsolute`
 * - Convert between structured path parts and strings with `parse` and `format`
 * - Compute relative paths with `relative`
 * - Convert between file paths and `file:` URLs with `toFileUrl` and `fromFileUrl`
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * - Path strings are not checked against the file system; these operations only manipulate syntax
 * - `resolve` may consult the host current working directory when no absolute segment is supplied
 * - `fromFileUrl` only accepts valid `file:` URLs and rejects encoded path separators
 * - Use the service from the environment when writing portable Effect code instead of importing

/**
 * The `Pipeable` module defines the shared interface and implementation helpers

 * - Type values that expose a `.pipe(...)` method with the {@link Pipeable} interface
 * - Implement a custom `.pipe(...)` method with {@link pipeArguments}
 * - Reuse the standard implementation through {@link Prototype}, {@link Class}, or {@link Mixin}

/**
 * The `PlatformError` module defines the normalized error model used by

 * `SystemError`, for failures reported by the host platform or operating
 * system.
 *
 * Use this module when implementing or consuming platform services such as
 * file systems, terminal access, sockets, or other environment-specific APIs.
 * `SystemError` intentionally groups many low-level failures into a small set
 * of portable tags like `NotFound`, `PermissionDenied`, and `TimedOut`, while

 * - `SystemErrorTag` values are normalized categories, not necessarily raw

 *
 * **Mental model**
 *
 * - A pool owns a bounded set of acquired items and hands them out with {@link get}
 * - Each checkout is scoped; leaving the scope returns the item to the pool
 * - `concurrency` controls how many fibers may use the same item at once
 * - `targetUtilization` controls when the pool grows between its minimum and maximum sizes
 * - {@link invalidate} removes a specific item so it can be replaced lazily
 *

 * - Create an elastic pool with time-to-live reclamation using {@link makeWithTTL}
 * - Implement custom resizing and reclamation behavior with {@link makeWithStrategy}
 * - Borrow resources safely in scoped effects with {@link get}

 * - Pool construction and item checkout require `Scope`; closing the scope shuts
 *   down the pool or returns the borrowed item
 * - Failed acquisitions are represented by the `get` effect failing with the

/**
 * Predicate and Refinement helpers for runtime checks, filtering, and type narrowing.
 * This module provides small, pure functions you can combine to decide whether a

 *
 * Mental model:
 * - A `Predicate<A>` is just `(a: A) => boolean`.
 * - A `Refinement<A, B>` is a predicate that narrows `A` to `B` when true.
 * - Guards like `isString` are predicates/refinements for common runtime types.
 * - Combinators like `and`/`or` build new predicates from existing ones.
 * - `Tuple` and `Struct` lift element/property predicates to compound values.
 *
 * Common tasks:
 * - Reuse an existing predicate on a different input shape -> {@link mapInput}
 * - Combine checks -> {@link and}, {@link or}, {@link not}, {@link xor}
 * - Build tuple/object checks -> {@link Tuple}, {@link Struct}
 * - Narrow `unknown` to a concrete type -> {@link Refinement}, {@link compose}
 * - Check runtime types -> {@link isString}, {@link isNumber}, {@link isObject}
 *
 * Gotchas:
 * - `isTruthy` uses JavaScript truthiness; `0`, "", and `false` are false.
 * - `isObject` excludes arrays; use {@link isObjectOrArray} for both.
 * - `isIterable` treats strings as iterable.
 * - `isPromise`/`isPromiseLike` are structural checks (then/catch), not `instanceof`.
 * - `isTupleOf` and `isTupleOfAtLeast` only check length, not element types.

 * end-of-input with a `Cause.Done<Done>` value.
 *
 * **Mental model**
 *
 * - `Pull` is an `Effect` with a distinguished completion signal in the error channel
 * - ordinary failures and completion are both represented by `Cause`, but can be separated with the helpers in this module
 * - the `Done` value can carry leftover state or a final value needed by a downstream consumer
 * - `Pull` is useful when repeatedly evaluating an effect until it either produces values, fails, or reports that no more input is available

 * - Extract type parameters from a pull: {@link Success}, {@link Error}, {@link Leftover}, {@link Services}
 * - Detect and filter completion: {@link isDoneCause}, {@link filterDone}, {@link filterNoDone}
 * - Recover from completion while preserving ordinary failures: {@link catchDone}

 * - `Cause.Done` is not an ordinary failure; use this module's helpers before treating a pull failure as an error
 * - `Done` lives in the error channel, so generic `Effect` error handling can catch it unless you filter it deliberately

 *
 * **Mental model**
 *
 * - A queue is a fiber-aware channel with one write side ({@link Enqueue}) and

 * - Producers add values with {@link offer} or {@link offerAll}; consumers
 *   remove values with {@link take}, {@link takeN}, {@link takeBetween}, or

 * - Bounded queues use an overflow strategy: {@link bounded} suspends

 *   old values
 * - Queues can be completed with {@link end}, failed with {@link fail} or
 *   {@link failCause}, interrupted with {@link interrupt}, and shut down with
 *   {@link shutdown}
 * - Operations are expressed as `Effect` values so waiting producers and
 *   consumers compose with interruption, scheduling, and structured
 *   concurrency
 *
 * **Common tasks**
 *
 * - Create queues: {@link make}, {@link bounded}, {@link dropping},
 *   {@link sliding}, {@link unbounded}
 * - Restrict capabilities: {@link asEnqueue}, {@link asDequeue}
 * - Produce values: {@link offer}, {@link offerAll}
 * - Consume values: {@link take}, {@link takeN}, {@link takeBetween},

 * - Signal lifecycle: {@link end}, {@link fail}, {@link failCause},
 *   {@link interrupt}, {@link shutdown}
 * - Inspect state: {@link size}, {@link isFull}
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * - `take` waits when the queue is empty; use {@link poll} when absence should

/**
 * Context-aware redaction for sensitive values.
 *
 * The `Redactable` module provides a protocol for objects that need to present
 * alternative representations of themselves depending on the runtime context.
 * Typical use cases include masking secrets, tokens, or personal data in logs, traces,
 * and serialized output.
 *
 * ## Mental model
 *
 * - **Redactable** - an object that implements `[symbolRedactable]`, a method
 *   that receives the current `Context` and returns a replacement value.
 * - **symbolRedactable** - the well-known `Symbol` key that marks an object as
 *   redactable.
 * - **redact** - the primary entry point: pass any value and get back either its
 *   redacted form (if it is `Redactable`) or the original value unchanged.
 * - **getRedacted** - lower-level helper that calls `[symbolRedactable]` directly
 *   on a value already known to be `Redactable`.
 * - The `Context` passed to `[symbolRedactable]` comes from the current fiber.
 *   If no fiber is active, an empty `Context` is used.
 *
 * ## Common tasks
 *
 * - **Make a value redactable**: implement the {@link Redactable} interface by
 *   adding a `[symbolRedactable]` method.
 * - **Redact an unknown value**: call {@link redact} - it returns the original
 *   value when it is not redactable.
 * - **Check if a value is redactable**: use {@link isRedactable}.
 * - **Get the redacted form of a known `Redactable`**: use {@link getRedacted}.
 *
 * ## Gotchas
 *
 * - `[symbolRedactable]` receives the fiber's `Context` as its argument.
 * - Outside of an Effect runtime (no current fiber), `getRedacted` still works
 *   but passes an empty `Context`, so service lookups will not find anything.
 * - `redact` is not recursive: if a redactable object contains nested
 *   redactable values, only the outermost redaction is applied.
 *
 * ## Quickstart
 *
 * **Example** (Masking an API key)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Context, Redactable } from "effect"
 *
 * class ApiKey {
 *   constructor(readonly raw: string) {}

 *   [Redactable.symbolRedactable](_ctx: Context.Context<never>) {

/**
 * A module for reducing collections of values into a single result.
 *
 * A `Reducer<A>` extends {@link Combiner.Combiner} by adding an
 * `initialValue` (identity element) and a `combineAll` method that folds an
 * entire collection. Think `Array.prototype.reduce`, but packaged as a
 * reusable, composable value.
 *
 * ## Mental model
 *
 * - **Reducer** – a {@link Combiner.Combiner} plus an `initialValue` and a
 *   `combineAll` method.
 * - **initialValue** – the neutral/identity element. Combining any value with
 *   `initialValue` should return the original value unchanged (e.g. `0` for
 *   addition, `""` for string concatenation).
 * - **combineAll** – folds an `Iterable<A>` starting from `initialValue`.
 *   When omitted from {@link make}, a default left-to-right fold is used.
 * - **Purity** – all reducers produced by this module are pure; they never
 *   mutate their arguments.
 * - **Composability** – reducers can be lifted into `Option`, `Struct`,
 *   `Tuple`, `Record`, and other container types via helpers in those modules.
 * - **Subtype of Combiner** – every `Reducer` is also a valid
 *   `Combiner`, so you can pass a `Reducer` anywhere a `Combiner` is
 *   expected.
 *
 * ## Common tasks
 *
 * - Create a reducer from a combine function and initial value → {@link make}
 * - Swap argument order → {@link flip}
 * - Combine two values without an initial value → use {@link Combiner.Combiner}
 *   instead
 *
 * ## Gotchas
 *
 * - `combineAll` on an empty iterable returns `initialValue`, not an error.
 * - The default `combineAll` folds left-to-right. If your `combine` is not
 *   associative, order matters. Pass a custom `combineAll` to {@link make} if
 *   you need different traversal or short-circuiting.
 * - A `Reducer` is also a valid `Combiner` — but a `Combiner` is *not* a
 *   `Reducer` (it lacks `initialValue`).
 *
 * ## Quickstart
 *
 * **Example** (summing a list of numbers)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Reducer } from "effect"
 *
 * const Sum = Reducer.make<number>((a, b) => a + b, 0)
 *
 * console.log(Sum.combine(3, 4))
 * // Output: 7
 *
 * console.log(Sum.combineAll([1, 2, 3, 4]))
 * // Output: 10
 *
 * console.log(Sum.combineAll([]))
 * // Output: 0
 * ```

 * `RequestResolver` describes how to collect, batch, execute, cache, trace,
 * and complete those requests.
 *
 * **Mental model**
 *
 * - A resolver receives one or more `Request.Entry` values and must complete
 *   each entry with either a success or failure
 * - Concurrent requests made with the same resolver can be gathered into a
 *   batch before the resolver is run
 * - Batch keys split pending requests into independent groups, which is useful
 *   when different backends, tenants, or query shapes must be resolved
 *   separately
 * - Delays and `batchN` tune how long requests are collected and how large
 *   each batch may become
 * - Resolvers can be wrapped with tracing, in-memory caching, cache services,
 *   and persistence without changing the request type
 *
 * **Common tasks**
 *
 * - Create a resolver from batch logic: {@link make}
 * - Create grouped batch logic: {@link makeGrouped} or {@link grouped}
 * - Create a resolver from pure logic: {@link fromFunction} or

 * - Add operational behavior: {@link around}, {@link race}, {@link withSpan}
 * - Reuse results: {@link withCache}, {@link asCache}, {@link persisted}
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * - Every entry passed to a resolver must be completed; leaving an entry
 *   incomplete causes the waiting request to fail
 * - Batched result collections must line up with the input entries in order
 *   and length when using the batched helper constructors
 * - Grouping controls which requests share a resolver run; choose stable keys
 *   for requests that can safely be handled together
 * - Caching and persistence depend on request identity and the request's

 *
 * **Mental model**
 *
 * - A `Resource` wraps an acquisition `Effect` whose result is kept in a

 * - Each refresh re-runs acquisition and replaces the stored `Exit`
 * - Replacing the stored value releases resources associated with the previous

 * - Read the current value with {@link get}
 * - Force a reload with {@link refresh}
 * - Check whether an unknown value is a resource with {@link isResource}

/**

 * (`Success<A>`) or fail (`Failure<E>`). Unlike `Effect`, `Result` is
 * evaluated eagerly and carries no side effects.
 *
 * **Mental model**
 *
 * - `Result<A, E>` is a discriminated union: `Success<A, E> | Failure<A, E>`
 * - `Success` wraps a value of type `A`, accessed via `.success`
 * - `Failure` wraps an error of type `E`, accessed via `.failure`
 * - `Result` is a monad: chain operations with {@link flatMap}, compose pipelines with `pipe`
 * - All operations are pure and return new `Result` values; the input is never mutated
 * - `Result` is yieldable in `Effect.gen`, producing the inner value or short-circuiting on failure

 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * - `E` defaults to `never`, so `Result<number>` means a result that cannot fail
 * - {@link andThen} accepts a `Result`, a function returning a `Result`, a plain value, or a function returning a plain value; {@link flatMap} only accepts a function returning a `Result`
 * - {@link all} short-circuits on the first `Failure` and returns it; later elements are not inspected
 * - {@link getOrThrow} throws the raw failure value `E`; use {@link getOrThrowWith} for custom error objects
 * - {@link tap} runs a side-effect but does not change the result; its return value is ignored

 * - **Encoding** — turning typed values back into a serializable format.
 * - **Codec** — a schema that tracks both Type and Encoded, so it can decode
 *   *and* encode. Most concrete schemas are Codecs.
 * - **Check / Filter** — a constraint attached to a schema (e.g. `isMinLength`,
 *   `isGreaterThan`). Attach them with `.check(...)`.
 * - **Transformation** — a pair of functions (decode + encode) that convert
 *   values between two schemas. Created with {@link decodeTo} / {@link encodeTo}.
 * - **Annotation** — metadata attached to a schema (title, description, custom
 *   keys). Attach with `.annotate(...)`.
 *
 * ## Common tasks
 *
 * - Define a struct: {@link Struct}
 * - Define a union: {@link Union}, {@link TaggedUnion}, {@link Literals}
 * - Define an array: {@link ArraySchema}, {@link NonEmptyArray}
 * - Define a record: {@link Record}

 * - Generate JSON Schema: {@link toJsonSchemaDocument}

 * - Derive equivalence: {@link toEquivalence}
 *
 * ## Gotchas
 *
 * - `Schema.optional` creates `T | undefined` (key can be missing *or*
 *   `undefined`). Use `Schema.optionalKey` for exact optional properties.
 * - `decodeTo` is curried: use `from.pipe(Schema.decodeTo(to, ...))`.
 * - `decodeUnknownSync` throws on failure. Use `decodeUnknownExit` or
 *   `decodeUnknownOption` for non-throwing alternatives.
 * - Filters do not change the TypeScript type. Use {@link refine} or

 * need to inspect, traverse, or programmatically transform schema definitions.
 *
 * ## Mental model
 *
 * - **{@link AST}** — discriminated union (`_tag`) of all schema node types
 *   (e.g. `String`, `Objects`, `Union`, `Suspend`)
 * - **{@link Base}** — abstract base class shared by every node; carries
 *   annotations, checks, encoding chain, and context
 * - **{@link Encoding}** — a non-empty chain of {@link Link} values describing
 *   how to transform between the decoded (type) and encoded (wire) form
 * - **{@link Check}** — a validation filter ({@link Filter} or
 *   {@link FilterGroup}) attached to an AST node
 * - **{@link Context}** — per-property metadata: optionality, mutability,
 *   default values, key annotations
 * - **Guards** — type-narrowing predicates for each AST variant (e.g.
 *   {@link isString}, {@link isObjects})
 *

 * - Get the decoded (type-level) AST → {@link toType}
 * - Get the encoded (wire-format) AST → {@link toEncoded}
 * - Swap decode/encode directions → {@link flip}
 * - Read annotations → {@link resolve}, {@link resolveAt},
 *   {@link resolveIdentifier}
 * - Build a transformation between schemas → {@link decodeTo}
 * - Add regex validation → {@link isPattern}
 *
 * ## Gotchas
 *
 * - AST nodes are structurally immutable; modification helpers return new
 *   objects via `Object.create`.
 * - {@link Arrays} represents both tuples and arrays; {@link Objects}
 *   represents both structs and records.
 * - {@link toType} and {@link toEncoded} are memoized — same input yields
 *   same output reference.
 * - {@link Suspend} lazily resolves its inner AST via a thunk; the thunk is

/**
 * Composable transformation primitives for the Effect Schema system.
 *
 * A `Getter<T, E, R>` represents a single-direction transformation from an
 * encoded type `E` to a decoded type `T`. Getters are the building blocks
 * that `Schema.decodeTo` and `Schema.decode` use to define how values are
 * transformed during encoding and decoding. They handle optionality
 * (`Option<E>` in, `Option<T>` out), can fail with `Issue`, and can require
 * Effect services via `R`.
 *
 * ## Mental model
 *
 * - **Getter**: A function `Option<E> -> Effect<Option<T>, Issue, R>`. It
 *   transforms an optional encoded value into an optional decoded value,
 *   possibly failing or requiring services.
 * - **Passthrough**: The identity getter — returns the input unchanged. Used
 *   when no transformation is needed. Optimized away during composition.
 * - **Option-awareness**: Getters receive and return `Option` to handle
 *   missing keys in structs. `Option.None` means the key is absent.
 * - **Composition**: Getters compose left-to-right via `.compose()`. A
 *   passthrough on either side is a no-op (identity optimization).
 * - **Issue**: The error type for all getter failures (see `SchemaIssue`).
 *
 * ## Common tasks
 *
 * - Pass a value through unchanged → {@link passthrough}
 * - Transform a value purely → {@link transform}
 * - Transform a value with possible failure → {@link transformOrFail}
 * - Transform with full Option control → {@link transformOptional}
 * - Handle missing keys → {@link onNone}, {@link required}, {@link withDefault}
 * - Handle present values → {@link onSome}
 * - Validate a value with an effectful check → {@link checkEffect}
 * - Produce a constant value → {@link succeed}
 * - Always fail → {@link fail}, {@link forbidden}
 * - Omit a value from output → {@link omit}

 * - Transform strings → {@link trim}, {@link capitalize}, {@link toLowerCase}, {@link toUpperCase}, {@link split}, {@link splitKeyValue}, {@link joinKeyValue}
 * - Parse/stringify JSON → {@link parseJson}, {@link stringifyJson}
 * - Encode/decode Base64 → {@link encodeBase64}, {@link decodeBase64}, {@link decodeBase64String}
 * - Encode/decode Hex → {@link encodeHex}, {@link decodeHex}, {@link decodeHexString}
 * - Encode/decode URI components → {@link encodeUriComponent}, {@link decodeUriComponent}
 * - Parse DateTime → {@link dateTimeUtcFromInput}
 * - Decode/encode FormData → {@link decodeFormData}, {@link encodeFormData}
 * - Decode/encode URLSearchParams → {@link decodeURLSearchParams}, {@link encodeURLSearchParams}
 * - Build nested tree from bracket paths → {@link makeTreeRecord}
 * - Flatten nested tree to bracket paths → {@link collectBracketPathEntries}
 *
 * ## Gotchas
 *
 * - Getters are not bidirectional. To define a full encode/decode pair, supply
 *   both a `decode` and an `encode` getter to `Schema.decodeTo`.
 * - `passthrough` requires `T === E` by default. Use `{ strict: false }` to
 *   bypass the type constraint, or use {@link passthroughSupertype} / {@link passthroughSubtype}.
 * - `transform` skips `None` inputs (missing keys) — the function is only
 *   called when a value is present. Use `transformOptional` if you need to
 *   handle missing values.
 * - `parseJson` without a `reviver` returns `Schema.MutableJson`. With a
 *   reviver, the return type widens to `unknown`.
 * - `split` treats an empty string as an empty array, not `[""]`.
 *
 * ## Quickstart
 *
 * **Example** (Using SchemaGetter with Schema.decodeTo)

/**
 * Structured validation errors produced by the Effect Schema system.
 *
 * When `Schema.decode`, `Schema.encode`, or a filter rejects a value, the
 * result is an {@link Issue} — a recursive tree that describes *what* went
 * wrong and *where*. This module defines every node type in that tree and
 * provides formatters that turn an `Issue` into a human-readable string or a
 * Standard Schema V1 failure result.
 *
 * ## Mental model
 *
 * - **Issue**: A discriminated union (`_tag`) of all possible validation error
 *   nodes. It is recursive — composite nodes wrap inner `Issue` children.
 * - **Leaf**: A terminal issue with no inner children ({@link InvalidType},
 *   {@link InvalidValue}, {@link MissingKey}, {@link UnexpectedKey},
 *   {@link Forbidden}, {@link OneOf}).
 * - **Composite nodes**: Wrap one or more inner issues to add context —
 *   {@link Filter}, {@link Encoding}, {@link Pointer}, {@link Composite},
 *   {@link AnyOf}.
 * - **Pointer**: Adds a property-key path to an inner issue, indicating
 *   *where* in the input the error occurred.
 * - **Formatter**: A function `Issue → Format` that serialises the error tree.
 *   Two built-in factories are provided: {@link makeFormatterDefault} (plain
 *   string) and {@link makeFormatterStandardSchemaV1} (Standard Schema V1).
 *
 * ## Common tasks
 *
 * - Check if a value is an Issue → {@link isIssue}
 * - Extract the actual input from any issue → {@link getActual}
 * - Format an issue as a string → {@link makeFormatterDefault}
 * - Format an issue for Standard Schema V1 → {@link makeFormatterStandardSchemaV1}
 * - Customise leaf formatting → {@link defaultLeafHook}
 * - Customise filter formatting → {@link defaultCheckHook}
 *
 * ## Gotchas
 *
 * - `Pointer` and `MissingKey` carry no actual value — {@link getActual}
 *   returns `Option.none()` for them.
 * - `AnyOf`, `UnexpectedKey`, `OneOf`, and `Filter` store `actual` as a plain
 *   `unknown` (not `Option`), so {@link getActual} wraps them with
 *   `Option.some`.
 * - Calling `toString()` on any `Issue` uses the default formatter. To
 *   customise output, create your own formatter with

/**
 * The `SchemaParser` module turns schemas into reusable runtime operations for
 * constructing, validating, decoding, and encoding values. It is the execution
 * layer behind a schema's AST: parsers walk the schema structure, apply
 * transformations, honor parse options, run checks, and report failures as
 * `SchemaIssue.Issue` values.
 *
 * Use this module when you need a parser with a specific result shape:
 * `Effect` for effectful parsing and service requirements, `Promise` for
 * JavaScript interop, `Exit` or `Result` when failures should stay in data,
 * `Option` for yes/no validation, and synchronous helpers when throwing is the
 * desired boundary.
 *
 * Decoding reads from the encoded/input side of a schema into its decoded
 * `Type`, while encoding runs the schema in the opposite direction. The
 * `make*` helpers construct decoded values and apply constructor defaults before
 * validation. Parse options supplied when a parser is created are merged with
 * options supplied at call time, and schema-level parse annotations can further
 * refine behavior.

/**
 * Serializable intermediate representation (IR) of Effect Schema types.
 *
 * `SchemaRepresentation` sits between the internal `SchemaAST` and external
 * formats (JSON Schema, generated TypeScript code, serialized JSON). A
 * {@link Representation} is a discriminated union describing the *shape* of a
 * schema — its types, checks, annotations, and references — in a form that
 * can be round-tripped through JSON and used for code generation.
 *
 * ## Mental model
 *
 * - **Representation**: A tagged union (`_tag`) of all supported schema shapes:
 *   primitives, literals, objects, arrays, unions, declarations, references,
 *   and suspensions.
 * - **Document**: A single {@link Representation} paired with a map of named
 *   {@link References} (analogous to JSON Schema `$defs`).
 * - **MultiDocument**: Like `Document` but holds one or more representations
 *   sharing the same references.
 * - **Check / Filter / FilterGroup**: Validation constraints (min length,
 *   pattern, integer, etc.) attached to types that support them.
 * - **Meta types**: Typed metadata for checks on each category — e.g.
 *   {@link StringMeta}, {@link NumberMeta}, {@link ArraysMeta}.
 * - **Reviver**: A callback used by {@link toSchema} and {@link toCodeDocument}
 *   to handle `Declaration` nodes (custom types like `Option`, `Date`, etc.).
 * - **Code / CodeDocument**: Output of {@link toCodeDocument} — TypeScript
 *   source strings for runtime schemas and their type-level counterparts.
 *
 * ## Common tasks
 *
 * - Convert a Schema AST to a Document → {@link fromAST}
 * - Convert multiple ASTs to a MultiDocument → {@link fromASTs}
 * - Reconstruct a runtime Schema from a Document → {@link toSchema}
 * - Convert a Document to JSON Schema → {@link toJsonSchemaDocument}
 * - Convert a MultiDocument to JSON Schema → {@link toJsonSchemaMultiDocument}
 * - Parse a JSON Schema document into a Document → {@link fromJsonSchemaDocument}
 * - Parse a JSON Schema multi-document → {@link fromJsonSchemaMultiDocument}
 * - Generate TypeScript code from a MultiDocument → {@link toCodeDocument}
 * - Serialize/deserialize a Document as JSON → {@link DocumentFromJson}
 * - Serialize/deserialize a MultiDocument as JSON → {@link MultiDocumentFromJson}
 * - Wrap a Document as a MultiDocument → {@link toMultiDocument}
 *
 * ## Gotchas
 *
 * - `Declaration` nodes require a {@link Reviver} to reconstruct complex types
 *   (e.g. `Option`, `Date`). Without one, `toSchema` falls back to the
 *   declaration's `encodedSchema`. Use {@link toSchemaDefaultReviver} for
 *   built-in Effect types.
 * - `Reference` nodes are resolved against the `references` map in the
 *   `Document`. An unresolvable `$ref` throws at runtime.
 * - `Suspend` wraps a single `thunk` representation; it is used for recursive
 *   schemas. Circular references are handled by lazy resolution in
 *   {@link toSchema}.
 * - The `$`-prefixed exports (e.g. {@link $Representation}, {@link $Document})
 *   are Schema codecs for the representation types themselves — use them to
 *   validate or encode/decode representation data, not application data.
 *
 * ## Quickstart
 *
 * **Example** (Round-trip through JSON)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Schema, SchemaRepresentation } from "effect"
 *
 * const Person = Schema.Struct({
 *   name: Schema.String,
 *   age: Schema.Int
 * })
 *
 * // Schema AST → Document
 * const doc = SchemaRepresentation.fromAST(Person.ast)
 *
 * // Document → JSON Schema
 * const jsonSchema = SchemaRepresentation.toJsonSchemaDocument(doc)
 *
 * // Document → runtime Schema
 * const reconstructed = SchemaRepresentation.toSchema(doc)
 * ```

/**
 * Bidirectional transformations for the Effect Schema system.
 *
 * A `Transformation` pairs a decode `Getter` and an encode `Getter` into a
 * single bidirectional value, used by `Schema.decodeTo`, `Schema.encodeTo`,
 * `Schema.decode`, `Schema.encode`, and `Schema.link` to define how values
 * are converted between encoded and decoded representations. A `Middleware`
 * is the effect-level equivalent — it wraps the entire parsing `Effect`
 * pipeline rather than individual values.
 *
 * ## Mental model
 *
 * - **Transformation**: A pair of `Getter`s (decode + encode) that convert
 *   individual values bidirectionally. `T` is the decoded (Type) side, `E` is
 *   the encoded side. `RD`/`RE` are required Effect services.
 * - **Middleware**: Like `Transformation`, but each direction receives the full
 *   parsing `Effect` and can intercept, retry, or modify the pipeline.
 * - **Getter**: A single-direction transform `Option<E> → Effect<Option<T>, Issue, R>`
 *   (see `SchemaGetter`).
 * - **flip()**: Swaps decode and encode, turning a `Transformation<T, E>` into
 *   `Transformation<E, T>`.
 * - **compose()**: Chains two transformations left-to-right on the decode side
 *   and right-to-left on the encode side.
 * - **passthrough**: The identity transformation — no conversion in either
 *   direction.
 *
 * ## Common tasks
 *
 * - Convert values purely (sync, infallible) → {@link transform}
 * - Convert values with possible failure → {@link transformOrFail}
 * - Handle optional/missing keys → {@link transformOptional}
 * - Build from existing Getters → {@link make}
 * - No-op identity transformation → {@link passthrough}
 * - Subtype/supertype coercion → {@link passthroughSupertype}, {@link passthroughSubtype}
 * - Trim/case strings → {@link trim}, {@link toLowerCase}, {@link toUpperCase}, {@link capitalize}, {@link uncapitalize}, {@link snakeToCamel}
 * - Parse key-value strings → {@link splitKeyValue}
 * - Coerce string ↔ number/bigint → {@link numberFromString}, {@link bigintFromString}
 * - Coerce string ↔ Date/Duration → {@link dateFromString}, {@link durationFromString}
 * - Decode durations → {@link durationFromNanos}, {@link durationFromMillis}
 * - Wrap nullable/optional as Option → {@link optionFromNullOr}, {@link optionFromOptionalKey}, {@link optionFromOptional}
 * - Parse URLs → {@link urlFromString}
 * - Base64 ↔ Uint8Array → {@link uint8ArrayFromBase64String}
 * - Base64 ↔ string → {@link stringFromBase64String}
 * - URI component ↔ string → {@link stringFromUriComponent}
 * - JSON string ↔ unknown → {@link fromJsonString}
 * - FormData/URLSearchParams ↔ unknown → {@link fromFormData}, {@link fromURLSearchParams}
 * - Check if a value is a Transformation → {@link isTransformation}
 *
 * ## Gotchas
 *
 * - `Transformation` operates on individual values; `Middleware` wraps the
 *   entire parsing Effect. Choose accordingly.
 * - `passthrough` requires `T === E` by default. Use `{ strict: false }` to
 *   bypass, or use {@link passthroughSupertype} / {@link passthroughSubtype}.
 * - String transformations like `trim`, `toLowerCase`, and `toUpperCase` use
 *   `passthrough` on the encode side — they are lossy and do not round-trip.
 * - `durationFromNanos` encode can fail if the Duration cannot be represented
 *   as a `bigint`.
 *
 * ## Quickstart
 *
 * **Example** (Defining a custom transformation with Schema.decodeTo)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Schema, SchemaTransformation } from "effect"

 *   Schema.decodeTo(
 *     Schema.Number,

 *
 * A `ScopedCache` is itself created inside a scope. Calls to {@link get} run the

 *
 * - A sink is the terminal consumer used by `Stream.run`
 * - Sinks can consume zero, one, many, or all input elements before finishing

 * - Sink composition preserves typed errors and service requirements
 * - Most sinks are built from `Channel` internally, but users compose them with

 * - Fold input: {@link fold}, {@link foldEffect}, {@link foldLeft}

 *
 * **Mental model**

 * - A stream is a lazy description; it runs only when consumed with a `run*` function

/**
 * Utilities for creating, transforming, and comparing plain TypeScript objects
 * (structs). Every function produces a new object — inputs are never mutated.
 *
 * ## Mental model
 *
 * - **Struct**: A plain JS object with a fixed set of known keys (e.g.,
 *   `{ name: string; age: number }`). Not a generic key-value record.
 * - **Dual API**: Most functions accept arguments in both data-first
 *   (`Struct.pick(obj, keys)`) and data-last (`pipe(obj, Struct.pick(keys))`)
 *   style.
 * - **Immutability**: All operations return a new object; the original is
 *   never modified.
 * - **Lambda**: A type-level function interface (`~lambda.in` / `~lambda.out`)
 *   used by {@link map}, {@link mapPick}, and {@link mapOmit} so the compiler
 *   can track how value types change.
 * - **Evolver pattern**: {@link evolve}, {@link evolveKeys}, and
 *   {@link evolveEntries} let you selectively transform values, keys, or both
 *   while leaving untouched properties unchanged.
 *
 * ## Common tasks
 *
 * - Access a property in a pipeline → {@link get}
 * - List string keys with proper types → {@link keys}
 * - Subset / remove properties → {@link pick}, {@link omit}
 * - Merge two structs (second wins) → {@link assign}
 * - Rename keys → {@link renameKeys}
 * - Transform selected values → {@link evolve}
 * - Transform selected keys → {@link evolveKeys}
 * - Transform both keys and values → {@link evolveEntries}
 * - Map all values with a typed lambda → {@link map}, {@link mapPick},
 *   {@link mapOmit}
 * - Compare structs → {@link makeEquivalence}, {@link makeOrder}
 * - Combine / reduce structs → {@link makeCombiner}, {@link makeReducer}
 * - Flatten intersection types → {@link Simplify}
 * - Strip `readonly` modifiers → {@link Mutable}
 *
 * ## Gotchas
 *
 * - {@link keys} only returns `string` keys; symbol keys are excluded.
 * - {@link pick} and {@link omit} iterate with `for...in`, which includes
 *   inherited enumerable properties but excludes non-enumerable ones.
 * - {@link assign} spreads with `...`; property order follows standard
 *   JS spread rules.
 * - {@link map}, {@link mapPick}, {@link mapOmit} require a {@link Lambda}
 *   value created with {@link lambda}; a plain function won't type-check.

 *
 * **Mental model**
 *
 * - `Tracer` is the backend interface responsible for creating spans
 * - `Span` values represent Effect-managed operations with mutable lifecycle
 *   hooks for ending spans and adding attributes, events, or links
 * - `ExternalSpan` represents trace context imported from another tracing
 *   system so Effect spans can be parented by or linked to external work
 * - `ParentSpan`, `Tracer`, and related context references control propagation,

 * - Implement a custom tracing backend with {@link make}
 * - Provide or inspect parent span context with {@link ParentSpan}
 * - Convert external trace identifiers into Effect span values with

/**
 * Utilities for creating, accessing, transforming, and comparing fixed-length
 * arrays (tuples). Every function produces a new tuple — inputs are never
 * mutated.
 *
 * ## Mental model
 *
 * - **Tuple**: A fixed-length readonly array where each position can have a
 *   different type (e.g., `readonly [string, number, boolean]`).
 * - **Index-based access**: Elements are accessed by numeric index, and the
 *   type system tracks the type at each position.
 * - **Dual API**: Most functions accept arguments in both data-first
 *   (`Tuple.get(t, 0)`) and data-last (`pipe(t, Tuple.get(0))`) style.
 * - **Immutability**: All operations return a new tuple; the original is
 *   never modified.
 * - **Lambda**: A type-level function interface (from {@link Struct}) used by
 *   {@link map}, {@link mapPick}, and {@link mapOmit} so the compiler can
 *   track how element types change.
 *
 * ## Common tasks
 *
 * - Create a tuple → {@link make}
 * - Access an element by index → {@link get}
 * - Select / remove elements by index → {@link pick}, {@link omit}
 * - Append elements → {@link appendElement}, {@link appendElements}
 * - Transform selected elements → {@link evolve}
 * - Swap element positions → {@link renameIndices}
 * - Map all elements with a typed lambda → {@link map}, {@link mapPick},
 *   {@link mapOmit}
 * - Compare tuples → {@link makeEquivalence}, {@link makeOrder}
 * - Combine / reduce tuples → {@link makeCombiner}, {@link makeReducer}
 * - Check tuple length at runtime → {@link isTupleOf},
 *   {@link isTupleOfAtLeast}
 *
 * ## Gotchas
 *
 * - {@link pick} and {@link omit} use numeric indices, not string keys.
 * - {@link renameIndices} takes an array of stringified source indices
 *   (e.g., `["2", "1", "0"]`), not arbitrary names.
 * - {@link map}, {@link mapPick}, {@link mapOmit} require a Lambda value
 *   created with `Struct.lambda`; a plain function won't type-check.
 * - {@link isTupleOf} and {@link isTupleOfAtLeast} only check length, not
 *   element types.
 *
 * ## Quickstart
 *
 * **Example** (Creating and transforming a tuple)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { pipe, Tuple } from "effect"
 *
 * const point = Tuple.make(10, 20, "red")
 *
 * const result = pipe(
 *   point,
 *   Tuple.evolve([
 *     (x) => x * 2,
 *     (y) => y * 2
 *   ])
 * )
 *
 * console.log(result) // [20, 40, "red"]
 * ```

/**
 * Type-level utility types for TypeScript.
 *
 * This module provides generic type aliases used throughout the Effect
 * ecosystem. Everything here is compile-time only — there are no runtime
 * values. Use these types to manipulate object shapes, tagged unions, tuples,
 * and variance markers at the type level.
 *
 * ## Mental model
 *
 * - **Tagged union**: a union of objects each having a discriminating
 *   `_tag: string` field. {@link Tags}, {@link ExtractTag}, and
 *   {@link ExcludeTag} operate on these.
 * - **Reason**: a nested error pattern where an error has a `reason` field
 *   containing a tagged union of sub-errors. {@link ReasonOf},
 *   {@link ReasonTags}, {@link ExtractReason}, and {@link ExcludeReason} work
 *   with this pattern.
 * - **Variance markers**: {@link Covariant}, {@link Contravariant}, and
 *   {@link Invariant} are function-type aliases encoding variance for phantom
 *   type parameters.
 * - **Simplify**: {@link Simplify} flattens intersection types (`A & B`) into
 *   a single object type for cleaner IDE tooltips.
 * - **Concurrency**: {@link Concurrency} is a union type
 *   (`number | "unbounded" | "inherit"`) used across Effect APIs that accept
 *   concurrency options.
 * - **Marker types**: {@link unassigned} and {@link unhandled} are branded
 *   interfaces used internally to represent missing or unhandled type
 *   parameters.
 *
 * ## Common tasks
 *
 * - Flatten an intersection for readability → {@link Simplify}
 * - Check type equality at compile time → {@link Equals} / {@link EqualsWith}
 * - Merge two object types → {@link MergeLeft} / {@link MergeRight}
 * - Work with tagged unions → {@link Tags} / {@link ExtractTag} / {@link ExcludeTag}
 * - Work with nested reason errors → {@link ReasonOf} / {@link ExtractReason}
 * - Create fixed-length tuples → {@link TupleOf} / {@link TupleOfAtLeast}
 * - Strip `readonly` modifiers → {@link Mutable} / {@link DeepMutable}
 * - Encode variance in phantom types → {@link Covariant} / {@link Contravariant} / {@link Invariant}
 * - Check if a type is a union → {@link IsUnion}
 *
 * ## Gotchas
 *
 * - {@link TupleOf} with a non-literal `number` (e.g. `TupleOf<number, string>`)
 *   degrades to `Array<string>`.
 * - {@link MergeRecord} is an alias for {@link MergeLeft}; prefer
 *   {@link MergeLeft} or {@link MergeRight} for clarity.
 * - {@link NoInfer} uses the `[A][A extends any ? 0 : never]` trick, not the
 *   built-in `NoInfer` from TypeScript 5.4+.

/**
 * This module provides small, allocation-free utilities for working with values of type
 * `A | undefined`, where `undefined` means "no value".
 *
 * Why not `Option<A>`?
 * In TypeScript, `Option<A>` is often unnecessary. If `undefined` already models absence
 * in your domain, using `A | undefined` keeps types simple, avoids extra wrappers, and
 * reduces overhead. The key is that `A` itself must not include `undefined`; in this
 * module `undefined` is reserved to mean "no value".
 *
 * When to use `A | undefined`:
 * - Absence can be represented by `undefined` in your domain model.
 * - You do not need to distinguish between "no value" and "value is undefined".
 * - You want straightforward ergonomics and zero extra allocations.
 *
 * When to prefer `Option<A>`:
 * - You must distinguish `None` from `Some(undefined)` (that is, `undefined` is a valid
 *   payload and carries meaning on its own).
 * - You need a tagged representation for serialization or pattern matching across
 *   boundaries where `undefined` would be ambiguous.
 * - You want the richer `Option` API and are comfortable with the extra wrapper.
 *
 * Lawfulness note:
 * All helpers treat `undefined` as absence. Do not use these utilities with payloads
 * where `A` can itself be `undefined`, or you will lose information. If you need to
 * carry `undefined` as a valid payload, use `Option<A>` instead.

 * - **SingleShotGen** — an `IterableIterator` wrapper that yields its value

 *   Result, and other yieldable types so they work inside generator functions.
 * - **Gen** — a type-level signature for generator-based monadic composition
 *   (`gen` functions). Parametric over any `TypeLambda` so each module
 *   (Effect, Option, Result, ...) can expose its own `gen` with correct types.
 * - **Variance** — a type-level marker that encodes the variance (covariant,
 *   contravariant, invariant) of a `TypeLambda`'s type parameters.
 *   Used by {@link Gen} for type inference.
 *
 * ## Common tasks
 *
 * - Make a type yieldable in generators -> implement `[Symbol.iterator]()` returning a {@link SingleShotGen}
 * - Define a generator-based API for a new TypeLambda -> type it as {@link Gen}`<MyTypeLambda>`
 * - Encode variance for a higher-kinded type -> use {@link Variance}
 *
 * ## Gotchas
 *
 * - {@link SingleShotGen} yields its value only on the first `.next()` call.
 *   Calling `.next()` again returns `{ done: true }`. Iterating the same
 *   instance twice will skip the value on the second pass; call

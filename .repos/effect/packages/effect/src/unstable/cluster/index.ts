/**
 * The `ClusterCron` module provides a small integration between cron schedules
 * and cluster sharding. It turns a `Cron.Cron` schedule into a `Layer` that
 * coordinates one recurring job across a cluster by registering a singleton for
 * the initial scheduling step and a persisted entity message for each run.
 *
 * This is useful for distributed maintenance work such as periodic cleanup,
 * reconciliation, report generation, cache refreshes, or polling external
 * systems where the job should be owned by the cluster rather than by every
 * runner independently.
 *
 * **Mental model**
 *
 * - {@link make} registers a named cluster cron job as a layer
 * - a singleton schedules the first run for the selected shard group
 * - each run is delivered as a persisted entity message at its scheduled time
 * - after a run exits, the handler schedules the next occurrence
 * - stale runs can be skipped with `skipIfOlderThan`
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * - Job effects should be idempotent because persisted messages, retries, and
 *   runner failover are part of normal distributed execution.
 * - By default, the next run is calculated from the current time after the
 *   handler exits; use `calculateNextRunFromPrevious` when preserving the
 *   schedule cadence is more important than catching up from delays.
 * - Long outages can produce old scheduled messages; keep `skipIfOlderThan`
 *   aligned with the job's business semantics.

 * The `ClusterError` module defines the typed error values used by the

 *
 * These errors are useful when implementing cluster transports, runner
 * supervision, mailbox storage, and entity request handling. They make common
 * distributed-system failures explicit: a message may reach a runner that no
 * longer owns the entity, a runner may be unavailable or unregistered, a
 * payload may fail to decode, persistence may fail, a mailbox may be at
 * capacity, or an envelope may already be in progress.
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * - Entity ownership and runner availability can change while messages are in
 *   flight, so routing errors should generally be treated as retryable or
 *   recoverable by higher-level cluster logic.
 * - `MalformedMessage` points to a schema/serialization boundary failure,
 *   while `PersistenceError` preserves failures from durable mailbox storage.

 *
 * Cluster transports serialize the RPC payloads, not arbitrary runtime
 * annotation values. Prefer static, deterministic annotations, and use
 * {@link Dynamic} when a persisted or transactional decision depends on the

 * The `ShardingConfig` module defines the configuration used by a cluster

 * are assigned per group, and the timing settings used for locks, assignment
 * refreshes, health checks, entity lifecycle, and message polling.
 *
 * Use this module when wiring a sharded application locally with
 * {@link layer}, loading deployment settings from environment variables with
 * {@link layerFromEnv}, or overriding selected defaults for tests and
 * single-node development. In production, keep cluster-wide values such as
 * `shardsPerGroup` and shard groups consistent across runners, choose stable
 * externally reachable runner addresses, and tune lock expiration and refresh
 * intervals to match the storage backend and shutdown behavior of the

/**
 * The `ShardingRegistrationEvent` module defines the events emitted by

 * integrations that need to react when registrations are complete.
 *
 * Registration events describe local registration, not shard ownership or
 * execution. A runner may register an entity or singleton before it owns the
 * shard that will run it, and the events are in-memory notifications from the
 * `Sharding` service rather than persisted cluster state. For persisted
 * messages, treat registration as the point where the handler is available to
 * the runner; it does not imply that existing storage work has already been

/**
 * The `SingleRunner` module provides a ready-to-use layer for running the

 * configuration so durable entities and workflows can run without a fleet of
 * external runners.
 *
 * **Common tasks**
 *
 * - Start a local or embedded cluster runner backed by SQL message storage
 * - Run durable entities and workflows in development, tests, or small
 *   single-node deployments
 * - Choose SQL runner storage for persistence or in-memory runner storage for
 *   short-lived scenarios
 * - Override sharding configuration while still using the standard
 *   environment-based defaults
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * - The layer still requires a `SqlClient` because message storage is SQL-backed
 * - Runner health and runner coordination are no-op implementations, so this is
 *   for single-node use rather than multi-runner cluster coordination

 *
 * Use singletons for cluster-wide background work such as schedulers, polling
 * loops, maintenance jobs, or consumers that must not have one instance per
 * process. Because ownership can change during failover, the registered effect
 * should be interruptible, scoped, and able to resume work without assuming that

 * registration events, equality checks, hashing, and runner-local fiber
 * tracking.
 *
 * Use this module when observing singleton registrations or working with
 * sharding internals that need to tell which shard currently owns a singleton.
 * The shard id is derived from the singleton name and shard group at
 * registration time, so changing either value changes ownership and routing.
 * Ownership can also move as shard locks are acquired or released, so an address
 * identifies the target shard rather than guaranteeing that a particular runner
 * is currently executing the singleton.

/**
 * The `Snowflake` module provides compact, sortable identifiers for cluster

 *
 * - Creating ids without coordinating through a central database
 * - Ordering cluster events, entity ids, or log records by generation time
 * - Encoding ids as strings at service boundaries with {@link SnowflakeFromString}
 * - Decoding a generated id into timestamp, machine id, and sequence parts with {@link toParts}
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * - Uniqueness depends on each concurrent generator using a distinct machine id
 * - Generated ids are time-sortable, but they are not random or secret values
 * - The default generator prevents local clock drift from moving ids backward
 * - More than 4096 ids in the same millisecond advance the logical timestamp

/**

 *
 * **Common tasks**
 *
 * - Run a cluster worker over TCP or Unix sockets with {@link layer}
 * - Connect to other runners while exposing `Sharding` and `Runners` clients
 * - Embed a client-only cluster participant with {@link layerClientOnly} when
 *   the process should send messages but not receive shard assignments
 *
 * **Transport gotchas**
 *
 * - The server listen address comes from the provided `SocketServer` and is
 *   logged when {@link layer} starts
 * - TCP addresses are logged as `hostname:port`, while Unix socket addresses
 *   are logged as their filesystem path
 * - The client-only layer does not start a socket server; provide the full

 * they are acknowledged. It is the storage implementation to use when a cluster
 * needs durable request / reply state backed by `SqlClient` rather than an
 * in-memory store.
 *
 * The storage layer runs its own migrations and creates messages, replies, and
 * migration tables using the configured prefix (`cluster` by default). Choose a
 * stable prefix before deploying, because changing it points the runtime at a
 * different set of tables. Existing deployments should also keep the generated

 * registration, health tracking, shard acquisition, refresh, and release to be
 * coordinated through an external database instead of in-memory state.
 *
 * **Common tasks**
 *
 * - Provide the default storage layer with {@link layer}
 * - Use {@link layerWith} when multiple clusters share the same database and

 * - Create a storage implementation directly with {@link make} for custom layer
 *   composition
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * - Runner heartbeats and persisted shard locks expire according to
 *   `ShardingConfig.shardLockExpiration`; stale rows may be reused or cleaned up
 *   by later storage operations.
 * - PostgreSQL and MySQL use advisory locks by default, keeping shard ownership
 *   tied to a reserved database connection. Set
 *   `ShardingConfig.shardLockDisableAdvisory` when persisted lock rows should be

 * **Testing gotchas**
 *
